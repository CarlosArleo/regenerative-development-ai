## Glossary of Key Terms

### Regenerative Development

**Regenerative Development & Design (RDD):** Framework for development that increases the capacity of living systems (ecological, social, economic) to thrive.

**Story of Place:** Inquiry methodology to understand the essence, potential, and patterns of a specific place.

**Essential Processes:** Framework of 8 core processes necessary for place health (nourishment, shelter, resource generation, identity, participation, spirit, learning, whole-system integration).

**Three Spheres:** Economic, social, and ecological dimensions analyzed together as interdependent.

**Nested Scales:** Understanding how site-scale interventions connect to watershed, bioregion, and human settlement scales.

### AI & VDK

**VDK (Verified Dialectical Kernel):** Algorithm that detects extractive drift in governance structures during iterative refinement.

**Extractive Drift:** Pattern where governance language/structure gradually shifts toward external control despite sounding collaborative.

**Self-Justifying Language:** Sophisticated framing that makes extractive patterns sound empowering.

**Constitutional Alignment:** Ensuring governance structures adhere to stated principles and values.

### Community Governance

**Community Land Trust (CLT):** Community-controlled organization that owns land for perpetual affordability.

**Asset Lock:** Legal mechanism preventing sale of community assets for private gain.

**Community Sovereignty:** Community's right to self-determination and control over their development.

**Anti-Capture:** Safeguards preventing external entities from gaining control of community projects.
