### Stage 2: Process Stakeholder Responses

**What Happens:**
You input:

- All the quotes and themes from your workshops
- Your initial sense of place essence

The system outputs:

- Health assessment of 8 essential processes (0-100% each)
- Degradation patterns identified
- Leverage points revealed
- Updated, refined place essence
- Confidence level (High/Medium/Low)
- Guidance on whether to proceed or do more inquiry

**The Magic:**
The system holds the Essential Processes framework (Nourishment, Shelter, Resource Generation, Identity, Contribution, Spirit, etc.) and analyzes your data against this rigorous assessment model.

**Example Output:**

```
Process Health Matrix:
- Nourishment (water/nutrient flows): 20% [CRITICAL]
- Resource Generation/Exchange: 15% [MOST CRITICAL]
- Identity/Belonging: 25%
- Spirit/Inspiration: 30%

Priority Intervention: Resource Generation/Exchange

Rationale: Blocked economic flows are driving youth migration, 
which weakens all other processes. Create paid restoration work 
that reconnects youth to elders and place.

Updated Place Essence: 
"A place where ancestral wisdom seeks new hands to heal the coast"

Confidence: HIGH - Ready for design phase
```

**Your Role:**

- Take the essence back to the community
- Validate: "Does this capture your truth?"
- If YES → Stage 3
- If NO → More inquiry needed

**Time Saved:** 3-4 weeks of manual synthesis → 15 minutes
