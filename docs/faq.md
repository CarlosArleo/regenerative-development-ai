## General Practitioner Questions

### Q: Will this replace regenerative development practitioners?

**A:** No. Absolutely not.

This system  **cannot** :

* Facilitate workshops and hold space
* Build trust with communities
* Read body language or sense energy shifts
* Navigate local political dynamics
* Make final decisions
* Validate place essence authentically

This system  **can** :

* Hold theoretical frameworks (RDD, Essential Processes, VDK)
* Synthesize large amounts of data quickly
* Generate multiple governance scenarios
* Detect capture patterns humans might miss

**Think of it like:** A calculator doesn't replace mathematicians. It handles computation so mathematicians can focus on problem-solving. This system handles synthesis so you can focus on facilitation and relationship-building.

---

### Q: How accurate are the outputs?

**A:** Variable, but generally high-quality with human oversight.

**Stage 1 (Questions):** 90-95% usable

* Usually need minor cultural adaptation
* Occasionally miss local context
* Always review before use

**Stage 2 (Synthesis):** 80-90% accurate

* Depends heavily on input quality
* Better with more diverse stakeholder data
* Requires community validation

**Stage 3 (Design Brief):** 85-95% usable

* Strong theoretical grounding
* Needs practitioner review for feasibility
* Should be adapted by architects/designers

**Stage 4 (Governance):** 75-85% directly usable

* VDK catches things humans miss
* Requires understanding of local legal context
* Multiple pathways increase utility

**Bottom line:** Treat all outputs as high-quality first drafts requiring human judgment.

---

### Q: I'm not tech-savvy. Can I still use this?

**A:** Yes! If you can use a web form, you can use this.

**Required skills:**

* Fill out online forms
* Copy/paste text
* Upload files (PDFs, Word docs)
* Review and adapt generated content

**NOT required:**

* Coding or programming
* Understanding AI/ML
* Technical setup (if someone else hosts it)
* Command line usage

**Learning curve:** 2-4 hours to understand all stages

---

### Q: What if the system generates questions that don't fit my community's culture?

**A:** This is expected and why human adaptation is essential.

**What to do:**

1. **Review all questions** before using
2. **Adapt language** to local dialect/metaphors
3. **Remove** questions that don't fit
4. **Add** questions the system missed
5. **Reorder** to match local communication norms

**Example:**

* System: "What are the essential processes in your watershed?"
* Adapted: "When the beck (stream) is healthy, what do you see and hear?"

**You're the expert** on your community. The system provides structure, you provide cultural intelligence.

---

### Q: How much does it cost?

**A:** Currently in pilot phase (free for participants).

**Pilot Phase (Now):**

* Free for community projects
* In exchange for case study documentation
* Limited to 10-20 projects

**Post-Pilot (Planned):**

* Sliding scale: £100-£1,000 per project
* Based on community resources
* Always free for under-resourced communities
* Never extractive pricing

**Compare to:**

* Traditional consulting: £50,000-£200,000
* This system (future): £500-£2,000 typical
* DIY without support: £0 but low quality

**Funding options:**

* Lottery funding often covers this
* Power to Change grants
* Local authority budgets
* Crowdfunding

---

### Q: What if I don't agree with the system's assessment?

**A:** Trust your judgment. Always.

The system provides:

* One perspective (based on data you input)
* Probabilistic analysis (not certainty)
* Framework-based assessment (RDD lens)

**You provide:**

* On-the-ground knowledge
* Relationship context
* Intuitive understanding
* Years of experience

**If you disagree:**

1. **Note why** - what did the system miss?
2. **Use your assessment** instead
3. **Tell us** - helps improve the system
4. **Consider** - is there something you missed, or system missed?

**Your expertise > System outputs**

---

### Q: Can I use this for projects outside the UK?

**A:** Yes! The system is designed to be culturally adaptive.

**Works well for:**

* Any geographic context (UK, Colombia, India, Kenya, etc.)
* Different scales (village, neighborhood, bioregion)
* Various project types (housing, food, commons, planning)

**Requires:**

* Cultural adaptation by practitioner
* Local context knowledge
* Community validation

**Currently tested in:**

* UK (Carrington Moss, others in progress)
* Colombia (Bajo Baudó)
* Italy (San Martino - system development)

**Language support:**

* Currently: English
* Coming: Spanish, Welsh
* Community translations welcome

---

### Q: How long does each stage take?

**A:** AI processing is fast, human work varies.

**How to export:**

```
After each stage completes:
1. Click "Download Results"
2. Choose format (JSON or Markdown)
3. Save to your computer
```

**Data ownership:** You own all outputs. System doesn't retain after session ends (unless you save project).

---

### Q: Is my community's data secure?

**A:** Yes. Multiple security layers.

**Data protection:**

* All data encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
* Stored in Firebase (Google security standards)
* No data shared with third parties
* No training of AI models on your data
* Automatic deletion after 90 days (unless you save)

**What's stored:**

* Opt out of any storage

---

### Q: What if the system goes down during a critical project?

**A:** Multiple fallback options.

**Prevention:**

* System auto-saves progress
* Can export at any stage
* Backups every 24 hours

**If system unavailable:**

* Use downloaded Stage 1 questions (you have them)
* Manual synthesis (system outputs show methodology)
* Resume when system back online

**For critical projects:**

* Download all outputs immediately
* Keep local copies
* Don't rely solely on cloud storage

**Uptime target:** 99.5% (planned SLA)

**Current status:** Check [status page URL]

---

### Q: Can I modify the AI flows or frameworks?

**A:** Yes! It's open source.

**What you can modify:**

* Question generation prompts

* VDK parameters
* Constitution templates

**How:**

1. Fork the repository
2. Modify code in `backend/functions/src/ai/flows/`
3. Test locally
4. Deploy to your own Firebase
5. (Optional) Contribute back via PR

**See:** [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for details

**Note:** Modifications must maintain community sovereignty principles (license requirement).

---

## Ethical Practitioner Questions

### Q: Is it ethical to use AI in community development?

**A:** Complex question. Our position:

**Ethical if:**

* ✅ Community knows AI is being used
* ✅ Community can opt out
* ✅ Human facilitator maintains control
* ✅ Used to democratize access (not extract)
* ✅ Transparent about limitations
* ✅ Community owns all outputs

**Unethical if:**

* ❌ Used to bypass community engagement
* ❌ Community unaware of AI use
* ❌ Replaces human judgment
* ❌ Extracts value from communities
* ❌ Creates dependency on technology
* ❌ Imposed top-down

**This system:**

* Designed with ethics first
* Community sovereignty paramount
* Transparent by default
* Open source (inspect-able)
* Anti-capture mechanisms (VDK)

**Our principle:** Technology should serve communities, never the reverse.

---

### Q: What if the AI perpetuates colonial or extractive patterns?

**A:** Valid concern. We've built safeguards, but vigilance required.

**Built-in protections:**

1. **VDK** - Detects extractive drift in governance
2. **Multiple pathways** - No single "optimal" solution imposed
3. **Human oversight** - Practitioner reviews everything
4. **Community validation** - Community must approve outputs
5. **Open source** - Anyone can inspect for bias

**Risks remain:**

* AI trained on predominantly Western data
* May miss cultural context
* Could reinforce dominant narratives
* Technical language can exclude

**What we do:**

* Continuously test in diverse contexts
* Seek feedback from Global South practitioners
* Adapt prompts based on cultural input
* Prioritize community voice over AI outputs

**What you should do:**

* Stay critical of all outputs
* Adapt for cultural context
* Center community wisdom
* Report bias when you see it

**We're learning.** Help us do better.

---

### Q: Does this system respect Indigenous knowledge systems?

**A:** We're trying, but have limitations.

**Respectful elements:**

* Non-human stakeholders explicitly included
* Qualitative data valued (not just metrics)
* Multiple ways of knowing acknowledged
* No forced convergence to "optimal" answer

**Limitations:**

* System built on Western regenerative framework (RDD)
* AI trained predominantly on English text
* May not capture oral traditions well
* Assumes written documentation acceptable

**If working with Indigenous communities:**

1. **Ask consent** explicitly for AI use
2. **Adapt heavily** - system provides structure only
3. **Center oral traditions** - transcribe respectfully
4. **Respect protocols** - some knowledge shouldn't be digitized
5. **Community ownership** - they decide what gets documented

**We recognize:** Indigenous communities have thrived for millennia without AI. This tool is offered humbly, never imposed.

---

### Q: What about communities without internet access?

**A:** Hybrid approach possible.

**Offline-capable workflow:**

1. **Generate Stage 1 questions** (online, print out)
2. **Conduct workshops** (offline, paper-based)
3. **Transcribe responses** (offline)
4. **Upload for Stage 2** (online when accessible)
5. **Print Stage 2-4 outputs** (take back to community offline)

**Planned features:**

* Offline-capable Progressive Web App
* SMS-based input (for feature phones)
* Print-optimized outputs

**Current limitation:** Requires internet for AI processing

**Alternative:** Partner with nearby organization with internet access, batch process multiple projects

---

## Community Questions About System

### Q: Do we need to understand AI to use this?

**A:** No. Just like you don't need to understand engines to drive a car.

**What you need to understand:**

* System generates options based on your input
* Not magic, not oracle, not perfect
* You always have final say
* Can ask practitioner to explain any output

**What you don't need:**

* How neural networks work
* What "Gemini" or "VDK" means technically
* How code functions
* Firebase architecture

**Your role:** Provide wisdom about your place, evaluate if outputs resonate, make final decisions.

---

### Q: Can we opt out of using the AI system?

**A:** Absolutely. Always.

Your practitioner should offer:

1. **AI-assisted** approach (this system)
2. **Traditional** approach (manual synthesis)
3. **Hybrid** approach (some AI, mostly manual)

**You choose based on:**

* Comfort level with technology
* Cultural values
* Data sovereignty concerns
* Time/budget constraints

**If you opt out:**

* Process takes longer
* Costs more (practitioner time)
* Results still valid
* No judgment

**Your sovereignty, your choice.**

---

### Q: What happens to our stories and data?

**A:** You own it. Always.

**Data flow:**

1. **You share** stories in workshops
2. **Practitioner documents** (with your permission)
3. **System processes** (temporarily)
4. **Outputs generated**
5. **You receive** outputs
6. **System deletes** after 90 days (unless you save)

**You can request:**

* All data deleted immediately
* Export of all data
* No documentation in case studies
* Specific stories excluded

**For case studies:**

* Anonymized (no names)
* You review before publication
* You can veto anything
* You're credited (if you want)

**Your stories = your intellectual property**

---

### Q: Will this make decisions for us?

**A:** No. It generates options. You decide.

**Example (Stage 4):**

**System generates:**

* Pathway A: Municipal partnership (pros/cons)
* Pathway B: Community cooperative (pros/cons)
* Pathway C: Hybrid model (pros/cons)

**You decide:**

* Which pathway fits your values?
* Which matches your capacity?
* Which feels right for your place?
* Or create your own Path D?

**System's role:** Provide information

**Your role:** Make decision

**No algorithm makes final call. Ever.**

---

### Q: What if we disagree with the system's assessment?

**A:** Your lived experience > AI analysis. Always.

**If place essence doesn't resonate:**

* Tell practitioner
* Articulate what's missing
* System generates new version
* Or you write your own

**If governance pathway seems wrong:**

* Ask questions
* Request different options
* Explain why it doesn't fit
* Choose different path or create own

**The system is a tool, not an authority.**

Your knowledge of your place is irreplaceable.

---

## Community Data Privacy

### Q: Is our data anonymous?

**A:** Anonymized for case studies, but identifiable during process.

**During project:**

* Data linked to your community (system needs context)
* Stored securely
* Accessible only to your practitioner
* Not shared externally

**For case studies:**

* Community name changed (e.g., "Coastal Village, NW England")
* Individual names removed
* Identifying details obscured
* You review and approve before publication

**You control:**

* What gets documented
* What gets published
* Level of anonymization
* Whether to participate in case study at all

---

### Q: Can we delete our data later?

**A:** Yes, absolutely.

**How to delete:**

1. Contact your practitioner
2. Request deletion
3. All project data removed within 7 days
4. Confirmation sent to you

**What gets deleted:**

* All input data
* All outputs
* Session history
* Project files

**What remains:**

* Anonymized statistics (e.g., "X projects completed")
* Learning for system improvement (no personal data)

**GDPR right to be forgotten:** Fully supported

---

### Q: Who has access to our information?

**A:** Very limited access.

**Access levels:**

1. **Your practitioner:** Full access (needs it to help you)
2. **System administrator:** Technical access only (maintenance)
3. **No one else:** Data not sold, shared, or used for other purposes

**Not accessible to:**

* Other communities
* Developers (unless anonymized for case study)
* Third parties
* Government (unless legally required)
* Commercial entities

**Audit trail:** Maintained for who accessed what/when

* Google Cloud (backend)
* GitHub (version control)
* Vercel (optional deployment)

**See:** [backend/README.md](../backend/README.md) for architecture details

---

### Q: Can I self-host this?

**A:** Yes! It's designed to be deployable.

**Deployment options:**

1. **Firebase** (recommended, easiest)
2. **Vercel** (frontend) + Firebase (backend)
3. **Your own server** (requires more setup)

**Steps:**

1. Clone repository
2. Set up Firebase project
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy frontend: `npm run build && firebase deploy`
5. Deploy backend: `firebase deploy --only functions`

**Requirements:**

* Gemini API key (free tier available)
* Firebase project (free tier sufficient for low volume)
* Domain name (optional)

**Cost estimate:**

* **Free tier:** ~10 projects/month
* **Low usage:** £10-30/month
* **High usage:** £100-300/month

**See:** [docs/getting-started.md](getting-started.md)

---

### Q: How does the VDK work?

**A:** Complex! Here's simplified version:

**VDK = Verified Dialectical Kernel**

**Purpose:** Detect when governance refinements drift toward extractive patterns

**Process:**

1. **Generate** initial governance protocol
2. **Critique** against constitution + design brief
3. **Track** how language/structure changes
4. **Detect** patterns:
   * Coherent refinement (good)
   * Extractive drift (bad)
   * Self-justifying (very bad)
5. **Revert** if drift detected
6. **Generate** alternative pathway
7. **Repeat** for multiple pathways

**Key innovation:** Tracks epistemic dynamics (how ideas evolve), not just final state

**Mathematical basis:** Simplified version of formal verification + language analysis

**See:** [docs/stage-4-vdk-guide.md](stage-4-vdk-guide.md) for deep dive

---

### Q: Can I use a different AI model?

**A:** Yes, but requires code changes.

**Currently supported:**

* Gemini 2.5 Pro (primary)
* Gemini 2.5 Flash (fallback)

**To add other models:**

1. Implement adapter in `backend/functions/src/ai/adapters/`
2. Follow interface pattern
3. Update model selection logic
4. Test thoroughly (different models = different outputs)

**Potential models:**

* Claude (Anthropic)
* GPT-4 (OpenAI)
* Open source models (Llama, Mistral)

**Considerations:**

* Different models have different strengths
* Prompts may need adaptation
* Cost varies significantly
* Some features may not translate (VDK complex)

**See:** [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines

### Q: What's the deployment architecture?

**A:** Serverless, event-driven.

```
User Browser
    ↓ (HTTPS)
Next.js Frontend (Vercel/Firebase Hosting)
    ↓ (Firebase SDK)
Firebase Functions (Cloud Functions)
    ↓ (API calls)
Gemini API (Google AI)
    ↓ (responses)
VDK Processing (in-function)
    ↓ (results)
Firestore (data persistence)
```

**Benefits:**

* Auto-scaling
* Pay-per-use
* High availability
* Low maintenance

**Drawbacks:**

* Cold starts (first request slow)
* Vendor lock-in (Firebase)
* Cost unpredictable at scale

**Alternative:** Docker + Kubernetes for full control

## Developer Deployment Questions

### Q: What are the hosting costs?

**A:** Depends on usage.

**Free tier (Firebase):**

* 125K function invocations/month
* 1GB storage
* 10GB bandwidth
* ~10-20 projects/month

**Paid tier (typical):**

* £10-30/month for 50 projects
* £50-100/month for 200 projects
* £200-500/month for 1000 projects

**Cost breakdown:**

* Functions: £0.40 per million invocations
* Gemini API: £0.0025 per 1K tokens (Pro)
* Storage: £0.026/GB/month
* Bandwidth: £0.12/GB

**Optimization tips:**

* Cache common queries
* Use Flash model for simple requests
* Batch process where possible
* Monitor usage dashboard

---

### Q: How do I handle rate limits?

**A:** Gemini free tier is limited.

**Free tier:**

* 15 requests/minute
* 1,500 requests/day
* 1 million tokens/day

**Solutions:**

1. **Upgrade to paid:** Higher limits
2. **Queue requests:** Batch processing
3. **Cache responses:** Reduce repeat calls
4. **Use Flash model:** Cheaper, faster (for simple tasks)

**Implementing queue:**

typescript

```typescript
// In Firebase Functions
exportconst processQueue = functions.pubsub
.schedule('every 2 minutes')
.onRun(async(context)=>{
// Process queued requests
});
```

**See:** [backend/README.md](../backend/README.md) for queue implementation

## General Questions

### Q: Is this really free?

**A:** Pilot phase is free. Future pricing TBD with community.

**Current (Pilot):**

* Free for community projects
* In exchange for case study
* Limited slots

**Future (Planned):**

* Sliding scale based on resources
* Free tier for under-resourced communities
* Paid tier for well-resourced organizations
* Never extractive pricing

**Commitment:** Will always maintain free access for communities who need it most.

---

### Q: What's the long-term vision?

**A:** Community-owned infrastructure for regenerative development.

**Vision:**

1. **Accessible:** Any community, anywhere can use
2. **Community-owned:** Governed by practitioners + communities
3. **Open source:** Inspectable, adaptable, forkable
4. **Multi-lingual:** Works in local languages
5. **Offline-capable:** No internet dependency
6. **Integrated:** Works with existing tools/processes

**Not:**

* Venture-backed startup
* Proprietary platform
* Extractive business model
* Top-down imposed

**Governance (future):** Platform cooperative or community trust

**See:** [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md)

---

### Q: Can I trust this system?

**A:** Trust, but verify.

**Reasons to trust:**

* Open source (inspect code)
* Theoretical grounding (RDD, not invented here)
* Anti-capture mechanisms (VDK)
* Community sovereignty by design
* Pilot-tested with real communities

**Reasons to stay cautious:**

* AI systems make mistakes
* Cultural bias possible
* Technology can fail
* No system is perfect
* Your judgment matters most

**Our ask:** Use critically, report issues, help us improve.

**Your responsibility:** Review all outputs, validate with community, maintain control.
