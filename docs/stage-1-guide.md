### Stage 1: Generate Inquiry Questions

**What Happens:**
You input:

- Project name and location
- Current tensions (what problems exist)
- Historical patterns (what used to work)
- Bioregion context
- Which stakeholder groups to engage

The system outputs:

- 15-20 deep, culturally-sensitive questions per stakeholder group
- Complete 6-hour workshop protocol
- Facilitation guidance
- Materials list

**The Magic:**
The system draws on thousands of regenerative inquiries, pattern language, and place-based wisdom to generate questions that reveal essence, not just extract data.

**Example Output:**
*For Elders:*

> "If you close your eyes and remember this coast as a young person, what sounds of the mangrove and the sea come to you first? What smells?"

> "In the old ways of stewardship, what did the mangroves ask of the people in order to stay healthy and strong?"

**Your Role:**

- Adapt questions to local culture
- Facilitate workshops with deep listening
- Document responses carefully
- Build trust with community

**Time Saved:** 2-3 weeks of question design â†’ 10 minutes
