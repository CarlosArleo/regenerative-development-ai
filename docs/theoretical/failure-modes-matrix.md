# Failure Modes Matrix

Why Single-Constraint Optimization Always Fails

## The Four Quadrants

### QUADRANT 1: Low NL, Low SL (Bottom Left)

❌ **EXTRACTIVE CHAOS** (Neither constraint satisfied)

**Characteristics:**

- Ignores biophysical limits AND justice
- Extractive in all dimensions
- Rapid collapse inevitable

**Examples:**

- Unconstrained resource extraction
- Authoritarian petrostates
- Colonial plantation economies

**Failure Mode:** Ecological collapse + Social revolution

---

### QUADRANT 2: High NL, Low SL (Bottom Right)

⚠️ **TECHNOCRATIC EFFICIENCY** (NL satisfied, SL violated)

**Characteristics:**

- Physically viable but unjust
- Efficient extraction and concentration
- Optimizes metrics, ignores people

**Examples:**

- "Smart cities" with surveillance infrastructure
- Profit-driven energy infrastructure
- Industrial monoculture agriculture
- Geoengineering without consent

**Failure Mode:** Social alienation → Political instability

---

### QUADRANT 3: Low NL, High SL (Top Left)

⚠️ **ASPIRATIONAL IDEALISM** (SL satisfied, NL violated)

**Characteristics:**

- Ethically sound but physically non-viable
- Ignores resource limits and entropy
- Good intentions meet thermodynamics

**Examples:**

- Utopian communes ignoring carrying capacity
- "Post-growth" economics without transition plan
- Participatory processes that can't scale

**Failure Mode:** Entropic decay → Resource depletion

---

### QUADRANT 4: High NL, High SL (Top Right)

✓ **CONSTITUTIONAL VIABILITY** (BOTH constraints satisfied)

**Characteristics:**

- Physically viable AND just
- Maintains coherence dialectically
- Regenerative + Redistributive

**Examples:**

- Community land trusts with regenerative design
- Worker cooperatives within planetary boundaries
- Bioregional governance with equity mandates
- Commons with constitutional anti-capture

**Success Mode:** System resilience through dual coherence

---

## The Pattern

Most "sustainable development" ends up in Quadrant 2 (efficient but unjust).

Most "social justice movements" end up in Quadrant 3 (just but non-viable).

**Constitutional AI Forces Solutions into Quadrant 4**

By refusing to generate proposals that violate EITHER constraint, the VDK ensures only viable solutions emerge.
