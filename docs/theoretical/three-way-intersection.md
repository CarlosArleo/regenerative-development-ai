# Three-Way Intersection Diagram

The innovation emerges at the confluence of three epistemological frameworks.

## Concepts

**Regenerative Development:**

- Story of Place
- Essential Processes
- Three Spheres
- Nested Scales
- Systems Ecology
- Place-based Design

**Critical Urban Theory:**

- Spatial Justice
- Right to the City
- Metabolic Rift
- Abstract vs Lived Space
- Gentrification Analysis
- Anti-Extraction

**Constitutional AI:**

- Value Alignment
- Constitutional Constraints
- Dialectical Iteration
- Verification Mechanisms
- Bounded Exploration
- Pattern Detection

## Two-Way Intersections

**Regenerative + Critical = Regenerative Justice**
Healing land requires healing social relations

**Critical + AI = Capture Detection**
AI identifies extractive patterns in real-time

**Regenerative + AI = Ecological AI**
Algorithms grounded in living systems principles

## The Innovation (Center)

**Governance as Living Process**

Constitutional constraints that enforce:

- Ecological coherence
- AND spatial justice
- Simultaneously
