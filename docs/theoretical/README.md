# Theoretical Architecture Diagrams

These diagrams visualize the intellectual foundations of the project.

## Contents

1. **Three-Way Intersection** - Where the innovation emerges
2. **NL/SL Dialectical Space** - Core theoretical foundation
3. **Regenerative-Critical Synthesis** - What friction produces
4. **Stakes Diagram** - Risk vs. Possibility
5. **Failure Modes Matrix** - Why single constraints fail
6. **Constitutional Bridges** - Seven principles reconciling NL + SL

## Use Cases

### For Academic Writing

- Ground theoretical contributions
- Show rigor and depth
- Position against existing frameworks

### For Grant Proposals

- Demonstrate innovation (Three-Way Intersection)
- Show urgency (Stakes)
- Establish rigor (Failure Modes Matrix)

### For Presentations

- Opening hook (Stakes)
- Core innovation (Intersection)
- Why it matters (Failure Modes)
- How it works (Constitutional Bridges)

### For Public Communication

- Stakes: What hangs in the balance
- Synthesis: What becomes possible
- Bridges: How justice meets physics

## Notes

These are conceptual diagrams meant to convey relationships and structure, not quantitative precision.

The "mathematics" (P ∈ NL ∩ SL) is metaphorical representation of a logical requirement, not literal mathematical formalism.
