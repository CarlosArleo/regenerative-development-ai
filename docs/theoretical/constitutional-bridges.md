# Constitutional Principles as NL/SL Bridges

Each principle reconciles Natural Law and Social Law requirements.

## The Seven Principles

### 1. WHOLENESS

**Natural Law:** Systems Ecology

- Interdependent systems
- Ecological networks
- Trophic relationships

**Constitutional Bridge:** Integrate across human/non-human systems

**Social Law:** Collective Solidarity

- Multi-stakeholder inclusion
- Shared decision-making
- Beyond human exceptionalism

### 2. NESTEDNESS

**Natural Law:** Scale Hierarchies

- Nested ecosystems
- Fractal organization
- Cross-scale interactions

**Constitutional Bridge:** Respect scale and interdependence

**Social Law:** Subsidiarity

- Local decision authority
- Appropriate scale of action
- Federated governance

### 3. PLACE

**Natural Law:** Bioregional Specificity

- Unique ecological context
- Watershed boundaries
- Local material flows

**Constitutional Bridge:** Ground design in local context

**Social Law:** Cultural Sovereignty

- Self-determination
- Indigenous knowledge systems
- Anti-template solutions

---

### 4. RECIPROCITY

**Natural Law:** Thermodynamics

- Entropy balance
- Energy return on investment
- Material cycles

**Constitutional Bridge:** Ensure balance and return in all exchanges

**Social Law:** Justice & Equity

- Fair exchange
- No externalized costs
- Restorative distribution

### 5. NODAL INTERVENTIONS

**Natural Law:** Leverage Points

## Key Insight

**Each Principle is a Coherence Condition**

Not arbitrary values, but structural requirements for systems that maintain viability through dialectical tension between physical necessity and ethical obligation.
