# Natural Law / Social Law Dialectical Space

The core theoretical foundation: Constitutional viability exists only where Natural Law and Social Law constraints are both satisfied.

## The Constraint Framework

**Natural Law (NL) Boundary:**

- Thermodynamics
- Ecology
- Biology
- Physical Impossibility

**Social Law (SL) Boundary:**

- Justice & Equity
- Legitimacy
- Ethics
- Ethical Unacceptability

**Viable Space (Center):**
P ∈ (NL ∩ SL)

Constitutional viability is the intersection.

## Failure Zones

### ⚠️ FAILURE 1: NL Only (Bottom Right)

**Technocratic Efficiency**

- Optimizes natural law
- Violates social law
- Physically viable but unjust
- Examples:
  - Profit-driven development
  - Industrial monoculture
  - Technocratic systems

**Result:** Social alienation → Political instability

### ⚠️ FAILURE 2: SL Only (Top Left)

**Aspirational Idealism**

- Optimizes social law
- Violates natural law
- Ethically sound but non-viable
- Examples:
  - Utopian communes ignoring carrying capacity
  - Post-growth without transition
  - Participatory processes that can't scale

**Result:** Entropic decay → Resource depletion

### ⚠️ FAILURE 3: Neither (Bottom Left)

**Extractive Chaos**

- Ignores both constraints
- Result: Rapid collapse

### ✓ SUCCESS: Both (Top Right)

**Constitutional Viability**

- Maintains coherence dialectically
- Regenerative + Redistributive
- Examples:
  - Community land trusts with regenerative design
  - Worker cooperatives within planetary boundaries
  - Bioregional governance with equity mandates

*Key Insight:*

Most governance systems fail by optimizing ONE constraint while ignoring the other.

Constitutional AI enforces BOTH simultaneously.
