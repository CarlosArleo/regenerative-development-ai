npminstall -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# This will open browser for authentication
```

---

## Configuration

### Step 1: Firebase Project Setup

bash

```bash
# From project root
cd backend

# Initialize Firebase
firebase init

# Select:
# âœ“ Functions
# âœ“ Firestore
# ? Use existing project or create new? Create new
# ? Project name: regenerative-dev-ai-[yourname]
# ? Language: TypeScript
# ? ESLint: Yes
# ? Install dependencies: Yes
```

### Step 2: Get Gemini API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Click "Get API Key"
3. Create a new key
4. Copy the key (you'll need it in next step)

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

**Frontend (.env.local):**

bash

```bash
cd../frontend

# Create environment file
cat> .env.local <<EOF
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com

NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
EOF
```

**Backend (functions/.env):**

bash

```bash
cd../backend/functions

# Create environment file
cat> .env <<EOF
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
EOF

# Set in Firebase (for deployed functions)
firebase functions:config:set gemini.api_key="your_gemini_api_key_here"
```

### Step 4: Initialize Firestore

bash

```bash
# From backend directory
firebase firestore:indexes

# Create initial indexes (if prompted)
```

---

## Your First Project

### Step 1: Start Development Server

bash

```bash
# Start frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Server starts at http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 2: Load Sample Data

**Option A: Use Carrington Moss Example**

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and enter:

**Project Name:** `Carrington Moss Alternative Vision`

**Location:** `Carrington, Greater Manchester`

**Tensions:** `6500 home development on green belt, peatland destruction`

**Historical Patterns:** `peatland commons, local food production`

**Bioregion:** `Greater Manchester Wetlands`

**Stakeholders:** Select `long_term_residents`, `environmental_groups`, `local_farmers`

**Option B: Load from File**

bash

```bash
# Copy sample data
cp examples/sample-stage1-input.json /tmp/test-input.json

# Manually copy values into the form
```

### Step 3: Run Stage 1

1. Click **"Run Stage 1: Generate Inquiry Questions"**
2. Wait for processing (1-2 minutes)
3. Review generated questions
4. Download or copy questions for workshops

**Expected Output:**

* 15-20 questions per stakeholder group
* Complete workshop protocol
* Facilitation guidance
* Materials list

### Step 4: Simulate Stage 2

For testing without real workshops:

bash

```bash
# Use sample responses
cp examples/sample-stage2-input.json /tmp/stage2-test.json
```

Enter sample responses in Stage 2 form:

**Elder Responses:**

```
We used to gather on the moss for community events
The peatland provided us with fuel and food
Young people don't understand its value anymore
```

**Environmental Group Responses:**

```
The moss stores massive amounts of carbon
Rare species depend on this habitat
Development would be irreversible damage
```

Click **"Run Stage 2: Process Responses"**

**Expected Output:**

- Essential Processes health assessment
- Refined place essence
- Priority intervention identified
- Confidence level and next steps

### Step 5: Continue Through Stages

- **Stage 3:** Generate design brief
- **Stage 4:** Test governance pathways with VDK

---

## Understanding the Workflow

### The Four-Stage Process

```
Stage 1: Generate Questions
    â†“ (Conduct Workshops)
Stage 2: Synthesize Responses
    â†“ (Validate with Community)
Stage 3: Create Design Brief
    â†“ (Work with Designers)
Stage 4: Test Governance
    â†“ (Choose Pathway)
Implementation
```

### Time Estimates

| Stage   | AI Processing | Human Work                              | Total    |
| ------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Stage 1 | 2 min         | 2-3 weeks (workshop planning + conduct) | ~3 weeks |
| Stage 2 | 2 min         | 2 hours (data entry + validation)       | ~1 day   |
| Stage 3 | 3 min         | 1 day (review + adaptation)             | ~2 days  |
| Stage 4 | 10 min        | 1 day (document gathering + review)     | ~2 days  |

**Traditional consulting:** 4-8 months, Â£50k-Â£200k
**With this system:** 5-7 weeks, Â£0 (pilot) to Â£500-2000 (future pricing)

### Data Flow

```
Community Input (workshops, documents)
    â†“
Frontend (data entry, visualization)
    â†“
Firebase Functions (API layer)
    â†“
AI Flows (processing logic)
    â†“
Gemini API (AI generation)
    â†“
VDK (capture detection, validation)
    â†“
Outputs (questions, assessments, briefs, pathways)
    â†“
Community Review & Decision
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Frontend won't start

bash

```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
cd frontend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npminstall
npm run dev
```

#### "API key not found" error

bash

```bash
# Check environment variables are set
cat frontend/.env.local
cat backend/functions/.env

# Ensure no extra spaces or quotes
# Format: KEY=value (no quotes)
```

#### Firebase deployment fails

bash

```bash
# Check Firebase login
firebase login --reauth

# Check project is selected
firebase use --add

# Deploy with verbose logging
firebase deploy --only functions --debug
```

#### Gemini API errors

**Error: "API key invalid"**

* Verify key in Google AI Studio
* Check for copy-paste errors
* Ensure no extra spaces

**Error: "Rate limit exceeded"**

* Free tier: 60 requests/minute
* Wait a minute and retry
* Consider upgrading plan

**Error: "Model not found"**

* Check model name: `gemini-2.5-pro-latest`
* Verify API access in Google AI Studio

#### Stage 1 generates poor questions

**Issue:** Questions feel generic or inappropriate

**Solutions:**

* Add more context in "tensions" and "historical patterns"
* Be specific about place characteristics
* Include cultural context
* Try running again with refined inputs
* Manually adapt generated questions

#### Stage 2 confidence is LOW

**Issue:** "Need more inquiry" message

**Solutions:**

* Add more stakeholder responses
* Include more diverse perspectives
* Provide richer detail in responses
* Consider conducting additional workshops
* Don't proceed to Stage 3 if confidence is low

#### VDK rejects all pathways (Stage 4)

**Issue:** No governance pathways validated

**Solutions:**

* Review uploaded governance documents
* Check constitution selection
* Verify community design brief is clear
* Try different constitutional framework
* May indicate fundamental misalignment (good catch!)
