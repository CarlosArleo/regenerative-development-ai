### Stage 3: Generate Design Brief

**What Happens:**
You input:

- Community-validated place essence
- Proposed intervention
- Stakeholder commitments
- Essential processes assessment (from Stage 2)

The system outputs:

- Complete design brief for architects/designers
- Core design principles (derived from place essence)
- Three Spheres analysis (economic, social, ecological)
- Nested Scales visualization (site → bioregion)
- Design phase workshop protocol

**The Magic:**
The system translates place intelligence into actionable design guidance while maintaining traceability back to community wisdom.

**Example Output:**

```
Core Design Principles:
1. Honor ancestral wisdom in all physical forms
2. Create spaces for intergenerational knowledge transfer
3. Design for economic self-determination
4. Ensure reciprocity with mangrove systems

Three Spheres Synthesis:
- Economic: Ecotourism + carbon credits fund restoration
- Social: Youth employed, elders teaching, community empowered
- Ecological: Mangrove regeneration + biodiversity return
- Sweet Spot: Paid restoration work = all three aligned

Nested Scales:
- Site: 3 nursery locations
- Watershed: Improved water quality benefits coast
- Bioregion: Part of larger Chocó mangrove corridor
- Human Settlement: Youth retention strengthens village
```

**Your Role:**

- Review with design team
- Run design phase workshops
- Ensure designs stay traceable to place intelligence

**Time Saved:** 4-6 weeks of design brief writing → 20 minutes
