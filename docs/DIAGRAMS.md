# System Diagrams & Visual Guides

Complete visual documentation of the Regenerative Development AI system.

## Main Process Flow

The complete journey from community need to implementation. All four stages with inputs, processing, outputs, and decision points.

[View Diagram](visuals/process-flow-diagram.md)

**What it shows:**

- Stage 1: Generate Inquiry Questions
- Stage 2: Process Stakeholder Responses
- Stage 3: Generate Design Brief
- Stage 4: Governance Harmonization (VDK)
- Decision loops and iteration points
- Role of Community, Practitioner, and AI at each stage

---

## Actor Interaction Layers

How the Community, Practitioner, AI, and Outputs work together in a cyclical relationship.

[View Diagram](https://github.com/CarlosArleo/regenerative-development-ai/blob/main/docs/visuals/actor-interaction-diagram.md)

**Key insight:** This isn't linearâ€”it's a feedback loop where outputs inform new inquiry and validation.

## VDK Constitutional Architecture

Deep dive into how the VDK system detects extractive drift and iterates toward constitutionally-aligned governance.

[View Diagram](https://github.com/CarlosArleo/regenerative-development-ai/blob/main/docs/visuals/vdk-architecture-diagram.md)

**What it explains:**

- Seven constitutional principles that guide decisions
- Iterative refinement process (Iterations 1-5)
- How VDK detects extractive drift
- Rejection and correction loops
- Final pathway approval

## Seven Constitutional Principles

The foundational framework that ensures all governance pathways maintain community sovereignty and regenerative intent.

[View Diagram](https://github.com/CarlosArleo/regenerative-development-ai/blob/main/docs/visuals/seven-principles-diagram.md)

**The Seven Principles:**

1. **Wholeness** - Systems Ecology + Collective Solidarity
2. **Nestedness** - Scale Hierarchies + Subsidiarity
3. **Place** - Bioregional Context + Cultural Sovereignty
4. **Reciprocity** - Thermodynamics + Justice & Equity
5. **Nodal** - Leverage Points + Strategic Action
6. **Pattern Literacy** - Complexity Theory + Critical Theory
7. **Levels of Work** - Evolutionary Time + Intergenerational Justice

## How to Use These Diagrams

### For Communities

Start with the [Actor Interaction Layers](https://github.com/CarlosArleo/regenerative-development-ai/blob/main/docs/visuals/actor-interaction-diagram.md) to understand your role throughout the process.

### For Practitioners

Use the [Main Process Flow](https://github.com/CarlosArleo/regenerative-development-ai/blob/main/docs/visuals/process-flow-diagram.md) as your operational reference during projects. Refer to [Stage Guides](../stage-1-guide.md) for deep dives.

### For Developers & Architects

Study the [VDK Constitutional Architecture](https://github.com/CarlosArleo/regenerative-development-ai/blob/main/docs/visuals/vdk-architecture-diagram.md) to understand how the system prevents extractive governance patterns.

### For Policy Makers

Review the [Seven Constitutional Principles](https://github.com/CarlosArleo/regenerative-development-ai/blob/main/docs/visuals/seven-principles-diagram.md) to understand the theoretical foundation.
