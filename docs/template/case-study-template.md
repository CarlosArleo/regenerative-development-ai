# Complete Practitioner's Guide: Truly Regenerative Multi-Stage System

---

## **Overview: The Three-Stage Journey**

This system supports **community-centered regenerative development** in three distinct phases:

```
STAGE 1: Ask The Right Questions
↓
[Practitioner goes to field and conducts workshops]
↓
STAGE 2: Listen Deeply & Synthesize
↓
[Practitioner validates insights with community]
↓
STAGE 3: Generate Design Brief
```

**Key Principle:** The AI helps you **ask and synthesize**, but YOU and the community make all decisions.

---

## **STAGE 1: Generate Inquiry Questions**

### **What It Does:**

Creates culturally-appropriate workshop questions for each stakeholder group and a complete 6-hour workshop protocol.

### **When To Use It:**

- At the **beginning** of a new project
- When you know the place and tensions, but haven't engaged the community yet
- Before going into the field

### **What You Input (The Form):**

| Field                         | What It Is                                     | Example                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project Name**        | Name of your initiative                        | "San Martino Water Commons"                        |
| **Location Name**       | The specific place                             | "San Martino di Castrozza"                         |
| **Current Tensions**    | Problems the community faces (comma-separated) | "water scarcity, youth migration, knowledge loss"  |
| **Historical Patterns** | What used to work well (comma-separated)       | "waale system maintenance, collective stewardship" |
| **Bioregion**           | Larger ecological context                      | "Primiero Valley, Italian Dolomites"               |
| **Stakeholder Types**   | Who to talk to (checkboxes)                    | ☑ Elders, ☑ Young Returnees, ☑ Municipal Staff  |

### **What You Get:**

#### **1. Inquiry Questions by Stakeholder Group**

For EACH stakeholder you selected, you get:

- 15-20 deep, culturally-sensitive questions
- Organized into 4 thematic categories
- Usage guidance for how to facilitate

**Example for Elders:**

```
Category: "Memories of the Living Place"
Questions:
- "If you close your eyes and remember this place as a young person, 
   what sounds come to you first?"
- "Who were the teachers that taught you how to 'read' the water?"
```

#### **2. Complete 6-Hour Workshop Protocol**

Three sequential sessions:

- **Session 1:** First stakeholder group (1.5 hours)
- **Session 2:** Second stakeholder group (1.5 hours)
- **Session 3:** Cross-pollination walk (3 hours)

Each session includes:

- Opening ritual/activity
- Core inquiry questions
- Synthesis method
- Closing activity
- Materials list
- Preparation steps

**Example from Your Output:**

```
Session 1: "La Voz de la Memoria" (Voice of Memory)
- Elders gather in circle
- Share "chivo" (local drink)
- Tell stories about healthy relationships with land
- Create "Living Metaphor" artifact on plantain leaf
- Offer blessing for youth
```

### **What To Do Next:**

1. **Print the questions** for each stakeholder group
2. **Review the workshop protocol**
3. **Gather materials** (listed in protocol)
4. **Go to the field**
5. **Conduct the workshops** over 1-2 weeks
6. **Document everything:**
   - Direct quotes from participants
   - Emotional moments
   - Recurring themes
   - Stories about the past
   - Visions for the future
   - Contradictions or tensions

---

## **STAGE 2: Process Stakeholder Responses**

### **What It Does:**

Synthesizes workshop responses, assesses the health of essential ecological/social processes, and validates if you understand the place deeply enough to proceed to design.

### **When To Use It:**

- **After** conducting the workshops from Stage 1
- When you have documented responses from multiple stakeholder groups
- Before attempting any design work

### **What You Input (The Form):**

| Field                              | What It Is                                     | Example                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Project Name**             | Same as Stage 1                                | "San Martino Water Commons"                                                                            |
| **Location Name**            | Same as Stage 1                                | "San Martino di Castrozza"                                                                             |
| **Current Tensions**         | Same as Stage 1                                | "water scarcity, youth migration"                                                                      |
| **Elder Responses**          | Real quotes from elder workshop (one per line) | "The waale was maintained by everyone together.`<br>`Young people don't understand water is a gift." |
| **Youth Responses**          | Real quotes from youth workshop                | "We see potential in abandoned terraces.`<br>`Need secure water access for new businesses."          |
| **Municipal Responses**      | Real quotes from staff workshop                | "Budget constraints limit our actions.`<br>`Community engagement is key."                            |
| **Landscape Observations**   | What you noticed about non-human world         | "The mangroves are the lungs of the coast.`<br>`Birds return when forest is healthy."                |
| **Place Essence Hypothesis** | Your initial sense of the place's core story   | "A bridge between mountain and valley asking to reconnect"                                             |

### **What You Get:**

#### **1. Essential Processes Assessment**

Analysis of 8 core regenerative processes:

| Process                 | Health Score | What It Means                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Nourishment**   | 35%          | "Water and nutrient flows are degraded"      |
| **Identity**      | 80%          | "Cultural identity is strong and intact"     |
| **Participation** | 65%          | "Some engagement, but youth disconnected"    |
| **Reciprocity**   | 40%          | "Take-and-give balance is broken"            |
| **Potential**     | 70%          | "Latent capacity exists but not activated"   |
| **Integration**   | 50%          | "Generations not communicating well"         |
| **Whole-Part**    | 60%          | "Individual actions disconnected from whole" |
| **Co-evolution**  | 45%          | "Relationship with place is weakening"       |

#### **2. Updated Place Essence**

Refined articulation of the place's core story:

```
"Mountain-valley bridge seeking reconnection through water, 
where elder wisdom and youth energy meet to restore 
the waale system as a living commons"
```

#### **3. Confidence Level**

How sure the system is about understanding the place:

- **High/Validated:** Ready for Stage 3 (design)
- **Medium:** Need validation with community
- **Low:** Need more inquiry (return to Stage 1)

#### **4. Next Step Instructions**

Clear guidance on what to do:

```
If HIGH confidence:
→ "Validate this essence with the community. 
   If they say YES, proceed to Stage 3."

If LOW confidence:
→ "Conduct additional inquiry focused on: [specific area]
   Return to Stage 1 with new questions."
```

### **What To Do Next:**

1. **Review the Essential Processes Assessment**
   * Which processes are most degraded?
   * Which are strong?
   * What does this tell you about intervention priorities?
2. **Take the Place Essence back to the community**
   * Does it resonate?
   * Does it capture their truth?
   * What needs refinement?
3. **If community validates → Stage 3**
4. **If community questions → More inquiry (Stage 1)**

---

## **STAGE 3: Generate Design Brief**

### **What It Does:**

Creates a comprehensive design brief that architects/designers can use, grounded in community wisdom and regenerative principles.

### **When To Use It:**

* **After** Stage 2 shows HIGH confidence
* **After** community validates the place essence
* When you know the proposed intervention
* When stakeholders have made commitments

### **What You Input (The Form):**

---

## **Key Principles To Remember**

### **1. Human Agency**

The system  **suggests** , you  **decide** . Never skip community validation.

### **2. Sequential Not Simultaneous**

Don't jump ahead. Each stage builds on the previous.

### **3. Iterative If Needed**

Low confidence in Stage 2? Return to Stage 1 with new questions.

### **4. Documentation Is Critical**

The quality of Stage 2/3 depends on quality of your field notes.

### **5. Cultural Sensitivity**

Adapt the questions and protocols to local context.

## **Common Questions**

**Q: Can I skip Stage 1 if I already have questions?**
A: Yes, but the AI-generated questions might reveal blind spots.

**Q: What if Stage 2 says "low confidence"?**
A: Return to Stage 1, generate new questions for the specific gaps identified.

**Q: Can I edit the AI-generated questions?**
A: Absolutely! They're starting points. Adapt to your context.

**Q: What if stakeholders don't validate the essence?**
A: Don't proceed to Stage 3. Do more inquiry. Trust the process.

**Q: Can I run stages multiple times for the same project?**
A: Yes! Each time you click "Run Stage X" it generates fresh output.
