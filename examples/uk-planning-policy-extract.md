# UK Planning Policy Framework - Relevant Extracts

## National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) 2021

### Chapter 2: Achieving Sustainable Development

**Paragraph 7:** The purpose of the planning system is to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development. At a very high level, the objective of sustainable development can be summarised as meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

**Paragraph 8:** Achieving sustainable development means that the planning system has three overarching objectives, which are interdependent and need to be pursued in mutually supportive ways:

a) **Economic objective** – to help build a strong, responsive and competitive economy, by ensuring that sufficient land of the right types is available in the right places and at the right time to support growth, innovation and improved productivity; and by identifying and coordinating the provision of infrastructure;

b) **Social objective** – to support strong, vibrant and healthy communities, by ensuring that a sufficient number and range of homes can be provided to meet the needs of present and future generations; and by fostering a well-designed and safe built environment, with accessible services and open spaces that reflect current and future needs and support communities' health, social and cultural well-being;

c) **Environmental objective** – to contribute to protecting and enhancing our natural, built and historic environment; including making effective use of land, helping to improve biodiversity, using natural resources prudently, minimising waste and pollution, and mitigating and adapting to climate change, including moving to a low carbon economy.

### Chapter 5: Delivering a Sufficient Supply of Homes

**Paragraph 60:** To support the Government's objective of significantly boosting the supply of homes, it is important that a sufficient amount and variety of land can come forward where it is needed, that the needs of groups with specific housing requirements are addressed and that land with permission is developed without unnecessary delay.

**Paragraph 61:** To determine the minimum number of homes needed, strategic policies should be informed by a local housing need assessment, conducted using the standard method in national planning guidance – unless exceptional circumstances justify an alternative approach.

### Chapter 11: Making Effective Use of Land

**Paragraph 119:** Planning policies and decisions should promote an effective use of land in meeting the need for homes and other uses, while safeguarding and improving the environment and ensuring safe and healthy living conditions.

### Chapter 13: Protecting Green Belt Land

**Paragraph 137:** The Government attaches great importance to Green Belts. The fundamental aim of Green Belt policy is to prevent urban sprawl by keeping land permanently open; the essential characteristics of Green Belts are their openness and their permanence.

**Paragraph 138:** Green Belt serves five purposes:
a) to check the unrestricted sprawl of large built-up areas;
b) to prevent neighbouring towns merging into one another;
c) to assist in safeguarding the countryside from encroachment;
d) to preserve the setting and special character of historic towns; and
e) to assist in urban regeneration, by encouraging the recycling of derelict and other urban land.

**Paragraph 143:** Inappropriate development is, by definition, harmful to the Green Belt and should not be approved except in very special circumstances.

**Paragraph 144:** When considering any planning application, local planning authorities should ensure that substantial weight is given to any harm to the Green Belt. 'Very special circumstances' will not exist unless the potential harm to the Green Belt by reason of inappropriateness, and any other harm resulting from the proposal, is clearly outweighed by other considerations.

### Chapter 14: Meeting the Challenge of Climate Change

**Paragraph 152:** The planning system should support the transition to a low carbon future in a changing climate, taking full account of flood risk and coastal change. It should help to: shape places in ways that contribute to radical reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, minimise vulnerability and improve resilience; encourage the reuse of existing resources, including the conversion of existing buildings; and support renewable and low carbon energy and associated infrastructure.

**Paragraph 154:** New development should be planned for in ways that:
a) avoid increased vulnerability to the range of impacts arising from climate change;
b) can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and
c) are in line with strategies for adaptation.

### Chapter 15: Conserving and Enhancing the Natural Environment

**Paragraph 174:** Planning policies and decisions should contribute to and enhance the natural and local environment by:
a) protecting and enhancing valued landscapes, sites of biodiversity or geological value and soils;
b) recognising the intrinsic character and beauty of the countryside;
c) minimising impacts on and providing net gains for biodiversity;
d) preventing new and existing development from contributing to, being put at unacceptable risk from, or being adversely affected by, unacceptable levels of soil, air, water or noise pollution or land instability.

**Paragraph 180:** Plans should: distinguish between the hierarchy of international, national and locally designated sites; allocate land with the least environmental or amenity value; take a strategic approach to maintaining and enhancing networks of habitats and green infrastructure; and plan for the enhancement of natural capital at a catchment or landscape scale across local authority boundaries.

## Localism Act 2011 - Community Right to Bid

**Section 87:** A local authority must maintain a list of assets of community value in its area. An asset is of community value if:
(a) an actual current use of the building or other land that is not an ancillary use furthers the social wellbeing or social interests of the local community, and
(b) it is realistic to think that there can continue to be non-ancillary use of the building or other land which will further (whether or not in the same way) the social wellbeing or social interests of the local community.

## Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014

**Section 1:** A society may be registered under this Act as a community benefit society if:
(a) the business of the society is being, or is intended to be, conducted for the benefit of the community,
(b) the society satisfies the registration requirement, and
(c) the society is not a political party.

**Condition as to community benefit:**
The business of the society must be conducted:
(a) for the benefit of the community as a whole, or
(b) for a section of the community that is defined otherwise than by reference to residence in a particular place.

**Asset lock requirement:**
The society's registered rules must ensure that:
(a) the assets of the society are applied for the benefit of the community,
(b) any surplus is not distributed to members other than in specified circumstances, and
(c) on dissolution, assets are transferred to another community benefit society or charity.
