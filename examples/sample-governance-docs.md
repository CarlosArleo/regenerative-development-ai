## Creating Your Own Samples

When creating test documents:

1. **Use real policy excerpts** (publicly available)
2. **Anonymize specific names** if using real examples
3. **Include both good and problematic examples** (for VDK testing)
4. **Keep under 50 pages** (optimal for processing)
5. **PDF or Markdown format** (both supported)
