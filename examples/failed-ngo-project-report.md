# Project Evaluation Report: Coastal Restoration Partnership

**CONFIDENTIAL - For Learning Purposes**

---

## Executive Summary

**Project:** Mangrove Restoration Partnership
**Location:** [Anonymized Coastal Region]
**Timeline:** 2018-2021 (3 years)
**Partners:** International NGO + Local Community
**Budget:** $250,000 USD
**Status:** Discontinued, assets transferred to NGO

**Outcome:** Project failed to achieve sustainable community-led restoration. While ecological goals partially met, governance structure led to NGO control and community disempowerment.

---

## Project Overview

### Initial Vision

Community-led mangrove restoration with:

- Community ownership of nursery and restoration sites
- Traditional knowledge integrated with scientific methods
- Local employment and skill-building
- Revenue from carbon credits and ecotourism
- Democratic decision-making

### Actual Outcome

- NGO controlled all assets and decision-making
- Community became labor force, not owners
- Traditional knowledge sidelined
- Revenue went to NGO operational costs
- Community had advisory role only

## Governance Structure Analysis

### Initial Proposal (Year 1)

**Sounded good:**

> "Partnership between community and [NGO] to build capacity for sustainable mangrove restoration. Joint steering committee will ensure collaborative decision-making and shared ownership."

**Actual Structure:**
-**Steering Committee:** 50% NGO staff, 50% community representatives
-**Decision Process:** Consensus required (gave NGO effective veto)
-**Asset Ownership:** NGO owned nursery infrastructure, vehicles, equipment
-**Land Title:** Community land, but 10-year lease to NGO for "management"
-**Financial Control:** All funds held in NGO accounts

### Evolution (Year 2-3)

**How capture happened:**

**Language Shift:**

- Year 1: "Community-led partnership"
- Year 2: "NGO-managed with community participation"
- Year 3: "NGO project with community labor"

**Decision-Making Drift:**

- Initially: Both partners agreed on decisions
- Gradually: NGO "technical expertise" given deference
- Eventually: NGO made decisions, informed community

**Economic Capture:**

- Carbon credits: Registered to NGO (community unaware of process)
- Ecotourism: NGO took booking fees, paid community as guides
- Nursery sales: NGO kept revenue for "operational costs"

**Knowledge Extraction:**

- Traditional knowledge documented by NGO researchers
- Published in NGO reports (community not credited)
- Used to secure additional funding (community didn't benefit)

## Red Flags (That Were Missed)

### Governance Red Flags

**1. Asset Ownership:**

> "NGO will purchase equipment and infrastructure to ensure quality and accountability."

**Why problematic:** Community had no ownership, created dependency

**2. "Technical Oversight":**

> "NGO technical team will provide oversight to ensure scientific rigor."

**Why problematic:** "Oversight" became control, community knowledge devalued

**3. Joint Committee with Consensus:**

> "All decisions made by consensus ensures both partners agree."

**Why problematic:** Consensus gave NGO veto power, blocked community initiatives

**4. Capacity Building Language:**

> "We will build community capacity to eventually manage the project independently."

**Why problematic:** Implies community lacks capacity now, justifies NGO control

**5. Financial Management:**

> "NGO will manage funds to ensure compliance with donor requirements and financial best practices."

**Why problematic:** No community financial oversight, no transparency

### Language Red Flags

**Self-Justifying Patterns:**

- "Partnership" (but unequal power)
- "Capacity building" (but extracting knowledge)
- "Technical expertise" (devaluing traditional knowledge)
- "Empowerment" (while disempowering)
- "Sustainability" (but NGO-dependent)

**Extractive Framing:**

- Community as "beneficiaries" not "owners"
- Traditional knowledge as "local input" not "expertise"
- Community as "labor" not "decision-makers"
