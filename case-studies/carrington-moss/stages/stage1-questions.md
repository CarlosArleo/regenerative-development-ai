#### elders

* Before all the big changes, when you were young, what was the Moss's personality? If it were a living being, what was it like?
* Can you describe the sounds and smells of the Moss through the seasons back then? What did the air feel like?
* What stories did your parents or grandparents tell about the old ways of living with the Moss, perhaps about cutting peat for the fire?
* Tell me about the water here before so much was drained. How did it move, where did it rest, and how did it shape the life of the place?
* What plants or creatures were your regular companions on the Moss then that you don't see so much of anymore?
* Many people remember when the 'night soil' from Manchester was brought to fertilise the Moss. How did people talk about that change? What did it do to the relationship between the city and this land?
* When the big industries like the Shell chemical works arrived, what shifted in the rhythm of daily life here? What was gained for the community, and what do you feel was traded away for it?
* The Manchester Ship Canal changed everything. How did it change the way people here thought about the river and the wetlands? Did it feel like it separated things, or connected them in a new way?
* As the farms spread and the drains were cut deeper, how did the Moss itself seem to respond? What did it feel like to walk on or work with then?
* I've heard the M60 motorway is like a wall. Can you remember what it was like to move across that land before the road was there? What do you think the animals lost when it was built?
* We hear a lot about birds like the lapwing and curlew being gone. What was the relationship people had with those birds? Were their arrivals and departures markers of the seasons?
* In the past, how did people here make a living from, or with, the land and the water? What were the special skills a person needed to thrive in Carrington?
* Were there unwritten rules or a shared local wisdom about how to treat the Moss and its creatures? A sense of not taking too much?
* How did children play on or around the Moss? What did they learn from the land itself, without needing to be taught in a classroom?
* Beyond work, how did people connect with this place for celebration, for quiet, or for healing?
* If you were to walk on the Moss today and just listen, what do you feel it is trying to tell us now?
* With all the talk about building new houses and restoring the bog, what is the most important thing you feel the decision-makers are forgetting or can't see?
* What memories or knowledge about this place do you believe are most vital to pass on to the younger generations, so they can become good caretakers?
* If the Moss could begin to heal, what would be the very first signs you would look for? Not what a scientist might measure, but what you would see, hear, or feel.
* In your heart, what does a truly healthy and respectful relationship between the people of Carrington and Carrington Moss look like in the future?

#### young returnees

* Instead of just asking why you left, could you tell me the story of what called you back to Carrington? Was it a specific moment, a feeling, or a conversation?
* Many people see the old Shell works or the drained parts of the Moss as a problem to be fixed. When you look at those same places, what potential do you see that others might be missing?
* If Carrington had a voice, what do you think it was whispering to you that made you return when others from your generation might have stayed away?
* Describe a memory of this place from your childhood that feels vital now. How has your relationship with that place changed, and what does that change tell you about Carrington's own story?
* When you try to explain Carrington to friends who don't live here, what's the one feeling or story you share to capture its true character, beyond the headlines about development or pollution?
* When you talk with older family members about the future of Carrington Moss, where do your hopes align, and where do you find yourselves seeing things differently?
* Think about the skills your parents' or grandparents' generation had – from working at the chemical plant to tending an allotment. What pieces of that knowledge are vital to carry forward, and how could they be reimagined for the future you envision?
* The Moss has a long story of being transformed – for dumping waste, for farming, for industry. What pattern do you see in this history, and what does it suggest about the kind of role the community needs to play in its next chapter?
* What do you feel is the most important lesson from the boom and bust of heavy industry here that must be remembered as new economic ideas are explored?
* How do we honour the legacy of the industrial jobs that built families, while also healing the land and water from that same industry? What does that difficult balance feel like to you?
* Imagine it's 20 years from now and you've built a life here you're proud of. What does your daily life look like? How is your work connected to the health of the Moss and the community?
* Beyond just a job, what needs to be in place here for you and your friends to feel you can truly put down deep roots and thrive for the long term?
* What is the biggest obstacle you face in bringing your ideas for Carrington to life? Is it something physical, financial, or is it a particular mindset in the community?
* What kind of relationship between the town and the Moss needs to be nurtured for both to be truly healthy? What does that reciprocal connection look like in practice?
* When you hear about plans for massive housing estates, what courageous conversation do you think Carrington needs to have about growth, identity, and its duty to the land?
* If you were to take me to one spot on or near the Moss that speaks to you, where would we go? What would you want me to pay attention to with all my senses?
* The Moss used to store carbon, and now much of it releases carbon. If you could listen to what the land itself is expressing about this condition, what story would it tell?
* What does the presence of the M60 motorway feel like on the landscape? What does it interrupt, and what does its noise block out?
* The wading birds, like the lapwing and curlew, have been disappearing. What does their silence tell you about the health of the whole system here? What other, more subtle, signs of health or distress do you notice in the local plants and wildlife?
* How does the River Mersey and the Ship Canal shape the feeling of this place? What is their relationship with the Moss, and how has that changed over time?

#### municipal staff

* When you look at the official plans and strategies for Carrington, what is the untold story or the deeper aspiration for this place that isn't captured in the policy language?
* If Carrington itself—the Moss, the river, the neighborhoods—had a voice in your planning meetings, what do you think it would say about the current proposals for its future?
* Can you share a time when a decision or a plan had an unexpected outcome here, revealing something new about how Carrington works as a living system?
* Beyond fulfilling housing targets or economic goals, what does success for the community of Carrington look and feel like to you personally?
* How does the historical identity of Carrington as a place of industry, waste processing, and agriculture show up in the conversations you have today about its future?
* When you think about water's journey through Carrington – from rain falling on the Moss to flowing into the Mersey – what does its path tell you about the health of the land and the pressures of development?
* Historically, Manchester sent its waste 'night soil' here to create fertile land. What are the modern-day equivalents? What flows of resources, energy, or even waste does the wider region send to or demand from Carrington today?
* You see the official economic data, but what are the more informal or hidden economic relationships that give this community its unique character? How does the Moss itself participate in the local economy, in ways that aren't always measured?
* How has the M60 motorway changed the way people, wildlife, and even water move through and experience this place? What connections has it severed, and has it created any new, perhaps unexpected, ones?
* You are often at the center of the debate between housing needs and peatland conservation. Beneath the conflicting demands, what is the shared hope or common ground you've noticed? What do all parties seem to love about this place?
* Tell me about the different identities of Carrington you hear people talk about. Is it a future suburb, a nature reserve, a post-industrial landscape, a carbon store? How do you hold all these different truths in your work?
* When you hear people talk about the legacy of the Shell chemical works, what are the different emotions or lessons that come up? How does that memory influence conversations about what kind of industry or work is 'good' for Carrington now?
* What are the biggest misunderstandings you feel exist between those who want to 'develop' Carrington and those who want to 'protect' it? Where do you see the potential for a more creative, third way forward?
* Looking back at the massive transformations like the draining of the bog or the building of the Ship Canal, what can we learn about the long-term consequences of our decisions? What legacy do you hope today's decisions will leave in 100 years?
* What is a unique quality or strength you've observed in the Carrington community or its landscape that feels like a seed for a more regenerative future? What's something that is quietly trying to emerge here?
* If Carrington were to become a model for how a community can heal its relationship with a landscape like the Moss, what would be the first, most important story we would tell about how that happened?
* Imagine a future where the health of the peat bog and the health of the local economy were directly linked and mutually supportive. What might that look like on the ground? What would people be doing differently?

#### non human species

* If we were to look through the eyes of the grey partridge, where on the Moss would they show us the healthiest, most life-giving places, and why?
* The original Sphagnum mosses that built this bog are now rare here. If we were to go on a search for them, what would their presence or absence in a particular ditch or hollow tell us about the water and the soil?
* Some plants are the first to recolonize the ground near the old Shell works. What story are these pioneer species telling about the legacy of the industrial past and the land's capacity to heal itself?
* When you observe the insects on the Moss – the bees, the dragonflies – what are their movements telling you about the health and diversity of the plant life here?
* How does the Moss 'breathe' differently between the parts that are still wet and boggy, and the parts that have been drained for farming? What life is expressing itself in each of these places?
* Tell me about the last time you saw a curlew or a lapwing nesting on the Moss. What has changed in the places where they used to raise their young?
* If the bog could speak, what memories would it share of the vast, wet wilderness it once was before the drainage and the 'night soil' trains arrived?
* What would this place need to become for the wading birds to feel welcomed back? What would they need to see, hear, and feel to know it was a safe home again?
* As nature begins to reclaim the old industrial sites, which wild ones are the first to return? What does their arrival signal about the potential of these 'derelict' lands?
* If you were to follow a fox or a roe deer trying to move across this landscape, what story would their journey tell about the barrier of the M60 motorway?
* Where are the hidden pathways and corridors that wildlife still use to navigate between the Mersey, the Ship Canal, and the heart of the Moss?
* During a heavy rain, where does the water want to flow naturally on the Moss, and how is its path helped or hindered by the old drainage channels, the roads, and the new developments?
* How has the relationship between the River Mersey and Carrington Moss been changed by the Manchester Ship Canal? What conversations between them have been silenced?
* Which birds and insects act as messengers, carrying seeds and pollen between the isolated nature reserves and fragmented habitats? How vital is their work in keeping this landscape connected?
* Beyond their beauty, what is the 'work' that the plants and animals are doing here? How are they collectively building soil, purifying water, or managing the carbon in the peat?
* What does this particular place ask of the creatures that live here? What unique skills does a being need to thrive in a landscape of wet peat, old farmland, and industrial edges?
* What is the unique gift of the peat itself? What does it do for the entire Mersey Basin bioregion, even for people in Manchester who may never visit?
* What is the reciprocal relationship here? We know humans have taken peat, drained water, and built industry; what does the ecosystem now ask of us in return to restore its health?
