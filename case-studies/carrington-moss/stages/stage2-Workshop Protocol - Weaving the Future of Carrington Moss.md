# Workshop Protocol: Weaving the Future of Carrington Moss

**Phase:** Understanding

**Location:** Carrington, Greater Manchester, UK

**Duration:** 6 hours

**Stakeholder Groups:**

* Elders
* Young Returnees
* Municipal Staff
* Representatives for Non-Human Species

## Regenerative Principles

1. **Honor plural wisdoms** – Create safe, separate spaces where each group can share stories, knowledge, and perceptions freely, without interruption.
2. **Enable cross-pollination** – Facilitate intentional moments where insights from different groups intersect and evolve into shared understanding.
3. **Prioritize essence over consensus** – The goal is not to decide what to do, but to uncover what the place itself is asking for.
4. **Close with commitments** – End with co-created actions—personal or collective—that express care, reciprocity, and agency.

## Key Tensions at Carrington Moss

Carrington Moss exists at the intersection of ecology, economy, and community identity. Key tensions framing the inquiry include:

1. **Housing Development vs. Peatland Conservation** – Expansion pressures conflict with biodiversity and peat ecosystem preservation.
2. **Carbon Release from Degraded Peat** – Previously a carbon sink, degraded peat now emits carbon.
3. **Loss of Traditional Ecological Knowledge** – Generational disconnection weakens community memory of sustainable land stewardship.
4. **Legacy of Industrial Pollution** – Contaminated soils and waterways complicate restoration and safe reuse.
5. **Urban Expansion and Water Cycles** – Impermeable surfaces disrupt hydrology, raising flood risks and fragmenting ecosystems.
6. **Economic Decline and Sustainable Livelihoods** – Post-industrial decline demands new regenerative economic models linked to ecology and community well-being.
7. **M60 Motorway as Ecological Barrier** – Fragments wildlife corridors, isolating habitats.
8. **Extractive vs. Regenerative Business Models** – Shift needed from short-term extraction to long-term regenerative value creation.
9. **Fragmented Governance** – Multiple agencies with differing priorities; integrated stewardship across boundaries is required.

## Session Sequence

### Session 1: Listening to the Moss’s Memory

**Duration:** 1.5 hours

**Stakeholder Group:** Elders

**Objective:** Evoke embodied memory, sensory knowledge, and lived relationships with the Moss before and during industrial change.

**Opening: A Cup of Tea & Map of Memory**

Participants place stones on a large map to mark memories, sharing brief stories that anchor collective reflection.

**Core Activity: Story Circle**

* Facilitators guide storytelling to uncover relational and ecological knowledge.
* **Guiding Questions:**
  * What sounds, smells, and textures come to mind from pre-industrial Moss?
  * Can you tell a story about the water—its flow, its moods?
  * During the Shell works, what was gained and what was lost?
  * What does the Moss need from people now to begin healing?

**Synthesis: Harvesting the Essence**

**Closing:** Messages for Future Generations

* Elders offer one piece of advice or guidance, recorded on cards for later sessions.

**Materials:** Map, stones, tea, flip charts, markers, cards, pens

### Session 2: Imagining a Thriving Homecoming

**Duration:** 1.5 hours

**Stakeholder Group:** Young Returnees

**Objective:** Surface regenerative aspirations and future visions linking ecological health with economic vitality.

**Opening: The Call of Home**

Participants share one word/phrase describing what drew them back, creating a shared field of intention.

**Core Activity: Future Visioning Dialogue**

* Pairs and small groups explore the Moss’s potential through inquiry questions:
  * What hidden potential or overlooked strength do you see in Carrington?
  * If the Moss had a voice, what would it say?
  * How can ecological health and economic well-being sustain each other?
  * In 20 years, what new story will people tell about this place?

**Synthesis:** Mind Map of Potential

* Ideas visualized on a large mind map titled *A Thriving Carrington* with branches: Regenerative Livelihoods, Ecological Healing, Community Well-being, A New Identity.

**Closing:** Question for the Past

* Participants write one question for the elder generation, bridging intergenerational dialogue.

**Materials:** Large paper/whiteboard, sticky notes, pens, cards, refreshments

### Session 3: Walking in Many Footsteps

**Duration:** 3 hours

**Participants:** All stakeholder groups

**Objective:** Integrate memory, vision, and ecological perception into a shared sense of purpose and belonging.

**Opening: Council of All Beings**

* Gather at trailhead, facilitator reads elders’ messages.
* Groups introduce their roles; non-human representatives declare which life elements they will speak for.

**Core Activity: Sensory Walk & Story Stops**

* Guided walk with four thematic stops:
  1. **Tensions & Edges** – Dialogue near development zones
  2. **Listening in Silence** – Non-human inquiry prompts
  3. **Story Circle at Historical Site** – Share memory, insight, or emotion
  4. **Resilience Mapping** – Identify visible signs of recovery

**Guiding Questions:**

* What is pulling this place apart or holding it together?
* What is the strongest life force here and what does it need?
* If the Moss could guide its restoration, what first step would it ask?

**Synthesis:** Canvas of Shared Essence

* Participants inscribe one word or phrase on a large cloth capturing what the Moss is asking now.

**Closing:** Co-Created Commitments

* Each person declares one small action they will take within a month to honor the Moss.

**Materials:** Large canvas, natural markers, clipboards, pens, water, seating, weather protection

## Practitioner Reflection Prompts

* Where did I impose my own narrative instead of letting the system speak?
* Which voice—human or more-than-human—was quietest, and what does its silence mean?
* Which relationships visibly deepened, and how can the next phase nurture them?
