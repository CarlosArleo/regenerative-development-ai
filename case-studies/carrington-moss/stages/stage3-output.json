            "I've heard this was a place that fed many people. Can you tell me about the market gardens or allotments? What was the feeling of growing food from this soil and sharing it?",
            "When you think of a practice that people don't do anymore – maybe cutting peat, or tending to a certain crop – what was the wisdom behind doing it that way? What did you have to know about the land to get it right?"

            "Can you share a story about a time when the community had to pull together because of something the land or water did – a flood, a dry spell, an unexpectedly good harvest? What does that story tell us about the character of this place?",
            "How did people here used to understand wealth? Was it just about money, or was it about having clean water, good soil, and strong neighbours?"

Begin by genuinely honouring their role as a wisdom-keeper for the community. Follow the threads of their stories rather than sticking rigidly to the questions. Pay close attention to the emotions and relationships they describe – that is where the essence of place is often revealed. Be comfortable with silence, as it allows for deeper memories to surface. Your role is to listen with humility and curiosity, to learn what the place is through their eyes, and to thank them for the gift of their experience."

These young people hold a unique perspective, bridging the past they've inherited with a future they want to create. Your role is to create a space where their vision, their frustrations, and their deep connection to place can be fully expressed and heard.

PROJECT OVERVIEW**\n\n*   **Place Name & Context:** Carrington Moss, a historically significant peatland landscape on the urban fringe, currently home to a multi-generational community ('Old Carrington') and targeted for large-scale residential development.\n*   **Validated Place Essence:** Carrington Moss is a living, breathing system where the identity and spirit of a community are rooted in the soil. It is a place of deep memory, irreplaceable ecological function, and quiet resilience, currently under threat of erasure by an extractive development model.\n*   **Project Purpose:** To design a development model that regenerates, rather than degrades, the socio-ecological systems of Carrington Moss. The objective is not to build a generic 'modern village' but to prototype a symbiotic relationship between a human community and a peatland ecosystem. Success is defined by the measurable enhancement of ecological health, community wealth, and cultural identity.\n\n**B. NON-NEGOTIABLE DESIGN PRINCIPLES**\n\nThese principles are the constitutional foundation of the project. Any design proposal that violates them will be rejected.\n\n1.  **The Peatland is the Client:** All design must actively contribute to the hydrological and biological regeneration of the peat bog. (Derived from 'Nourishment' process degradation).\n2.  **Authenticity Over Aesthetics:** The design must emerge from and amplify the existing 'Old Carrington' identity; it cannot be imposed. (Derived from 'Identity & Belonging' degradation).\n3.  **The Place Pays Itself First:** The economic model must build local wealth and community assets, not extract them. (Derived from 'Resource Generation & Exchange' degradation).\n4.  **From Stakeholder to Steward:** The local community must have genuine, lasting decision-making power in a co-governance structure. (Derived from 'Meaningful Contribution' degradation).\n\n**C. PRIORITY INTERVENTIONS TO DESIGN FOR**\n\nYour design proposals must provide the spatial, architectural, and systemic framework for these two nodal interventions:\n\n1.  **Carrington Moss Peatland and Community Trust:** Design the physical infrastructure this trust needs. What does a carbon and biodiversity monitoring station look like? Where are the access points for restoration work? How does the landscape design tell the story of the Trust's work and the peatland's value?\n2.  **'Old Carrington' Community Land Trust (CLT):** Develop a masterplan and architectural typology for the CLT's land (to be sited on identified brownfield parcels). The design must be for permanently affordable, high-wellbeing homes and enterprise spaces that reflect the authentic identity of the place and foster strong community bonds.\n\n**D. MUST-HAVES**\n\n*   A comprehensive landscape plan for the active regeneration of the peatland, including hydrological management.\n*   A designated, legally protected 'no-build zone' covering all deep peat areas.\n*   A site plan and detailed design for the CLT that prioritizes community interaction, local food production, and connection to the wider landscape.\n*   A physical space for the Co-Governance Council to meet and for the community's cultural memory to be housed (e.g., a living archive or community hall).\n\n**E. MUST-NOT-DOS**\n\n*   **No building on deep peat.** No exceptions.\n*   **No generic 'suburban' housing typologies or materials.** All designs must be place-specific.\n*   **No use of marketing terms like 'New Carrington'.** All naming must be co-designed with the community.\n*   **No net-loss ecological mitigation.** All ecological interventions must be demonstrably regenerative (net-positive).\n*   **No designs that privatize access to or views of the restored Moss.** It must be a communal asset.\n\n**F. SUCCESS METRICS**\n\nYour design's success will be judged on its ability to achieve these outcomes:\n\n*   **Ecological:** >10% increase in the peatland water table within 5 years. Documented return of keystone species (e.g., curlews, water voles). Net-negative carbon status for the development within 10 years.\n*   **Economic:** At least 50% of the development's land value captured in community-owned assets (Peatland Trust, CLT). The establishment of at least 10 new local businesses within the CLT's enterprise spaces.\n*   **Social:** >80% of 'Old Carrington' residents who wish to remain are able to do so in the new CLT housing. A measurable increase in community trust and agency (via annual surveys). Qualitative evidence that the design is seen by residents as a true reflection of their identity.\n\n**G. STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT**\n\n*   The design team will work in direct partnership with a **Co-Governance Council** (to be formed from community representatives). This is not a client-consultant relationship; it is a co-design partnership.\n*   The Council holds **sign-off authority** at key project milestones: Concept Design, Detailed Design, and Material Selection.\n*   Regular, open design sessions with the wider community are mandatory."

The proposed leverage points aim to shift this dynamic from extraction to regeneration by making the invisible values (ecosystem services, community health, local identity) visible, valuable, and central to the design process.
