# Stage 3: Design Brief — Carrington Moss Regeneration

---

## 1. Validated Place Essence

**Essence Statement:**

> “Carrington Moss is a recovering being inviting kinship, teaching its people to repair through care.”

This essence has been **validated across all stakeholder archetypes** — Elders, Youth, Municipal Staff, and Non-Human Voices — and synthesizes meaning, memory, and potential for the place. The Moss is reframed not as a site for intervention but as a **living constitutional partner** with agency, cycles, and voice.

**Core Validations:**

| Source                  | Validation Insight                                                 | Alignment                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Elders                  | The Moss holds memory; healing requires listening.                 | Ecological Continuity      |
| Youth                   | Regeneration as creative re-inhabitation; livelihood through care. | Socioeconomic Regeneration |
| Municipal Staff         | Governance as stewardship; metrics as living indicators.           | Institutional Reflexivity  |
| More-than-Human Council | Healing through reciprocity and time.                              | Ontological Alignment      |

**Essence Validation Summary:**

* **Epistemic Integrity:** Coherent with local narratives and ecological truths.
* **Ontological Depth:** Frames the Moss as sentient, legitimizing ecological rights and multi-voice governance.
* **Strategic Relevance:** Provides a unifying narrative aligning ecological, social, and institutional goals.

**Validated Essence Statement:**

> “Carrington Moss is a recovering being whose vitality depends on relationships of kinship, reciprocity, and care. Regeneration here means learning to accompany its healing.”

## 2. Proposed Intervention

**Design Proposition:**

> “Regenerative Exchange Framework — Economy as Ecology”

A systemic intervention that  **ties ecological restoration directly to livelihood creation** , translating the place essence into practice. The intervention functions as a  **Regenerative District prototype** , combining hydrological, social, and economic regeneration into a living learning ecosystem.

**Intervention Logic:**

| Layer                  | Description                                                                                                       | Outcome                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Ecological Restoration | Rewetting peatlands, rewilding corridors, restoring carbon sink function.                                         | Improved hydrology & carbon sequestration |
| Ecological Economy     | Local enterprises regenerate ecosystems — e.g., carbon farming, native materials, ecological monitoring.         | Work = Care; livelihood = regeneration    |
| Digital Stewardship    | Real-time sensing of Moss vitality (water table, carbon flux, biodiversity) integrated into governance dashboard. | Data as relationship, not surveillance    |
| Cultural Renewal       | Co-creation spaces (Elder-Youth labs, Moss School, Art of Listening residencies).                                 | Reweaving of belonging and identity       |
| Governance Prototype   | Moss Guardianship Trust — hybrid legal entity representing the Moss’s rights and voice in land-use decisions.   | Living constitutional framework           |

**Prototype Vision — “The Carrington Commons”:**

A regenerative enterprise and guardianship zone where  **all value flows serve the living system** .

**Core Features:**

1. **Living Moss Dashboard:** Open ecological sensing system translating the Moss’s health into public metrics.
2. **Regenerative Works Hub:** Place-based cooperative for ecological entrepreneurship (rewilding, carbon repair, local craft).
3. **Moss Guardianship Trust:** Co-owned governance model embedding ecological rights into municipal decision-making.
4. **Commons Academy:** Education and arts platform teaching the “language of the living Moss.”

**Expected Outcomes (Systemic Impact):**

| Dimension  | Outcome                                           | Metric / Indicator                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Ecological | Peatland restoration; carbon sink recovery        | Water table levels, CO₂ balance, species return       |
| Social     | New forms of belonging and intergenerational care | Community participation rate, intergenerational events |
| Economic   | Local regenerative enterprises activated          | # of jobs in ecological livelihoods                    |
| Cultural   | Moss-centered identity and storytelling revived   | Local narrative proliferation, art collaborations      |
| Governance | Moss represented as legal/ecological actor        | Guardianship charter adopted by local authority        |
