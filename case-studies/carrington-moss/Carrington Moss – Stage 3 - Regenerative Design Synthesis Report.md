# **Carrington Moss – Stage 3 Regenerative Design Synthesis Report**

### **Purpose of Stage 3**

This stage translates the findings of the Stage 2 systemic assessment into an  **actionable regenerative design framework** .

It articulates a set of design principles, structural interventions, and nested-scale strategies to transform the Carrington Moss development from an extractive, top-down model into a  **co-governed, place-based act of regeneration** —ecologically, economically, and socially.

---

## **1. Context and Essence**

Carrington Moss is a site of profound ecological and cultural significance in Greater Manchester.

Once a living peatland commons, it now stands at the intersection of conflicting paradigms: *extractive development logic* versus  *regenerative stewardship* .

The Moss’ current essence can be summarized as:

> **“A suppressed wilderness asking to breathe and buffer the city.”**

This phrase captures both the ecological function (a living sponge mediating water, carbon, and climate) and the cultural potential (a repository of memory and care).

The Stage 2 diagnosis revealed that the **core pathology** of the proposed development lies in the  *erasure of identity and belonging* —a breakdown that propagates across all other living processes.

---

## **2. From Degradation to Regeneration**

### **Critical Degradation Pattern**

* **Identity & Belonging:** 16% health — the lowest of all essential processes.

  The planning system frames the land as “underused,” severing historical continuity and local agency.

### **Leverage Pathway**

To heal the system, *identity* must become the seed of regeneration.

When community identity, stewardship, and ecological vitality are treated as interdependent, Carrington can evolve from a contested landscape into a  **regenerative urban-rural threshold** .

---

## **3. Regenerative Design Principles**

Derived from the synthesis of all six essential processes, four **non-negotiable principles** guide every design and governance decision:

### **1. Cultural Continuity**

Design must *heal erasure* by embedding the community’s multi-generational stories and landscape identity in every layer of the new development.

* Begin with a **community-led cultural mapping** process.
* Integrate results into material, spatial, and symbolic design elements (street names, public art, landscape gestures).
* Require a  **Cultural Continuity Review** —with community veto power—at each design stage.

### **2. Rooted Stewardship**

The community is not a stakeholder; it is the **primary author and beneficiary** of place.

* Establish legally empowered **co-governance structures** (boards, trusts).
* Encode **community veto rights** in planning agreements.
* Replace consultation with **co-creation** and continuous stewardship (e.g., community farms, social enterprises).

### **3. Nested Viability**

Economic value must *emerge from* ecological health, not override it.

* Treat living systems as **core infrastructure** (peatlands, soils, water networks).
* Quantify ecosystem services (flood mitigation, carbon storage) within the project’s business model.
* Approve only designs demonstrating  **net-positive ecological impact** .

### **4. Generative Local Economy**

Shift from linear extraction to circular value flows.

* Establish a **Community Land Trust (CLT)** with an asset lock.
* Integrate spaces for local enterprise, food production, and cooperative economies.
* Ensure **land value uplift** circulates back into the community as shared wealth.

## **4. Nodal Interventions**

Two interventions serve as keystone actions capable of cascading benefits across all processes.

### **1. Co-Governed Cultural-Ecological Masterplan**

**Purpose:** Transform the process itself—making the community a co-author.

* **Structure:** A legally empowered Co-Governance Board with majority community representation.
* **Outcome:** A living masterplan rooted in cultural mapping and ecological knowledge.
* **Safeguards:** Legal veto power; independent facilitation; transparent decision logs.

**Cascading Benefits**

* *Ecological:* Local stewardship safeguards peatlands and biodiversity.
* *Economic:* Avoids costly conflicts, producing durable value through uniqueness.
* *Social:* Restores trust and belonging through shared authorship.

---

### **2. Community Land Trust (CLT) with Integrated Food Production**

**Purpose:** Anchor economic and ecological regeneration in community ownership.

* **Structure:** CLT holds land in perpetuity; manages affordable housing and productive landscapes.
* **Functions:** Housing + agriculture + education + community economy.
* **Safeguards:** Asset lock; tripartite governance (residents, community, experts); ecological covenants.

**Cascading Benefits**

* *Ecological:* Protects soils and promotes regenerative agriculture.
* *Economic:* Retains land value locally, fosters livelihoods.
* *Social:* Cultivates belonging and long-term security.

## **5. Three-Spheres Synthesis**

### **Core Pathology**

The existing model privileges **short-term financial gain** (economic sphere) while externalizing ecological and social costs.

The result: systemic fragility and public opposition.

### **Regenerative Potential**

Rebalancing the three spheres through co-governance and community ownership generates  **synergistic resilience** .

| Sphere               | Extractive Outcome                   | Regenerative Shift                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Ecological** | Peatland loss, habitat fragmentation | Peatland as carbon sink & flood buffer        |
| **Economic**   | Value exported to developers         | Value recirculated via CLT & local enterprise |
| **Social**     | Erasure, displacement                | Restored agency & belonging through co-design |

---

## **6. Synergies and Conflicts**

### **Synergies**

1. **CLT + Local Food Systems:** Creates a living economic-ecological feedback loop—soil health → food production → community wealth.
2. **Co-Governed Masterplan:** Unites municipal and citizen knowledge, embedding the land’s “memory and potential” into planning.

### **Conflicts and Resolution Strategies**

* **Housing Maximization vs. Whole-System Health:** Replace density metrics with  *whole-system value per hectare* .
* **Extractive Finance vs. Generative Economy:** Replace speculative finance with *place-based reinvestment mandates* and cooperative funding.

---

## **7. Nested Scales Analysis**

To illustrate how regenerative design functions across scales, Stage 3 includes a model **nested-scales analysis** (based on a parallel reforestation intervention):

* **Site Scale:** Direct soil building, erosion control, and habitat creation.
* **Watershed Scale:** Improved hydrology and reduced flood peaks.
* **Bioregional Scale:** Biodiversity corridors and cultural tourism benefits.
* **Planetary Scale:** Carbon sequestration and water cycle stabilization.

This nested logic underscores that **Carrington Moss is not an isolated site but a living node in the planetary system.**

---

## **8. Design Studio Brief – Summary**

* **Purpose:** To translate systemic principles into spatial, legal, and governance form.
* **Non-Negotiable Principles:** Cultural Continuity, Rooted Stewardship, Nested Viability, Generative Economy.
* **Core Deliverables:**
  * Co-Governed Masterplan
  * Community Land Trust
  * Peatland protection and no net soil loss
  * Integration of old and new village fabrics
  * Governance structure for perpetual community stewardship
* **Success Metrics:**
  * Ecological: Biodiversity, soil, water retention, food yield
  * Economic: Local value capture, affordability ratio, livelihood creation
  * Social: Sense of belonging, participation in governance, continuity of stories

## **9. Toward Implementation**

The design synthesis demonstrates that  **Carrington Moss can become a prototype for regenerative regional development** —where planning and design operate as instruments of healing.

**Immediate Next Steps**

1. Establish the **Co-Governance Board** and legal Terms of Reference.
2. Initiate the **Cultural & Ecological Mapping Process** as the foundation for design.
3. Form the **CLT** with a defined land allocation and asset lock.
4. Commission a **Whole-System Value Assessment** integrating ecosystem services and social value into economic modeling.

### **Conclusion**

Carrington Moss embodies a global challenge: how to regenerate damaged relationships between people, economy, and ecology.

Through the application of these Stage 3 design principles and nodal interventions, the Moss can evolve from a threatened landscape into a  **living model of regenerative cohabitation** —a place where development becomes an act of remembrance, reciprocity, and renewal.
