**Phase:** Understanding

**Location:** Carrington, Greater Manchester

**Total Duration:** 6 hours

This stage initiates the *Weaving the Wisdom of Place* process through carefully designed inquiry questions and a multi-session workshop protocol.

## **1. Stakeholder Inquiry Framework**

The inquiry process is organized around four primary stakeholder groups:

1. **Elders**
2. **Young Returnees**
3. **Municipal Staff**
4. **Non-Human Species (via community advocates)**

Each group’s questions are crafted to evoke *understanding* rather than extract information. They invite reflection, memory, emotion, and place-based wisdom.
