            "I've heard this was a place that fed many people. Can you tell me about the market gardens or allotments? What was the feeling of growing food from this soil and sharing it?",
            "When you think of a practice that people don't do anymore – maybe cutting peat, or tending to a certain crop – what was the wisdom behind doing it that way? What did you have to know about the land to get it right?"

            "Can you share a story about a time when the community had to pull together because of something the land or water did – a flood, a dry spell, an unexpectedly good harvest? What does that story tell us about the character of this place?",
            "How did people here used to understand wealth? Was it just about money, or was it about having clean water, good soil, and strong neighbours?"

Begin by genuinely honouring their role as a wisdom-keeper for the community. Follow the threads of their stories rather than sticking rigidly to the questions. Pay close attention to the emotions and relationships they describe – that is where the essence of place is often revealed. Be comfortable with silence, as it allows for deeper memories to surface. Your role is to listen with humility and curiosity, to learn what the place is through their eyes, and to thank them for the gift of their experience."

These young people hold a unique perspective, bridging the past they've inherited with a future they want to create. Your role is to create a space where their vision, their frustrations, and their deep connection to place can be fully expressed and heard.
