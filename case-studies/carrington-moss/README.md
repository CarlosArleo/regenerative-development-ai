# **The three stages (Inquiry, Assessment, and Design Brief)** are fully coherent with the **Theoretical Foundation**


### **Stage 1 – Story of Place Inquiry**

**Theoretical foundation:** Regenesis “Story of Place” methodology, phenomenology, indigenous knowledge, participatory action research.

**Observed in the Carrington Moss protocol:**

* Deep listening through **stakeholder-specific dialogues** (elders, youth, council, non-human beings).
* Inquiry questions designed to  **surface lived experience, memory, and sense of place** .
* Facilitation methods (e.g.  *Sharing Table* ,  *Story Circle* ,  *Walk of Witness* ) embody **phenomenological and indigenous principles** — privileging presence, storytelling, and embodied knowing.
* **No imposition of frameworks or metrics** — essence allowed to emerge organically.

✅ **Coherence:** Perfect.

This stage operationalizes the “Story of Place” framework exactly as described in the Theoretical Foundation. It resists extractive data-gathering and cultivates the kind of dialogical epistemology Regenesis and Carol Sanford advocate.

### **Stage 2 – Essential Processes Assessment**

**Theoretical foundation:** Carol Sanford’s *Seven First Principles of Regeneration* + Regenesis’ “Process Ecology” + Donella Meadows’ systems thinking.

**Observed in the Carrington Moss dataset:**

* Assessment across **six essential processes** (nourishment, shelter, resource exchange, identity, contribution, spirit).
* Each process analyzed through **ecological, economic, and social health metrics** — reflecting the  *multi-dimensional systemic lens* .
* **Leverage points** identified at systemic rather than symptomatic levels (e.g. land trusts, co-housing, flood-mitigation valuation).
* Root conflict recognized as  **loss of identity and belonging** , consistent with Sanford’s focus on *essence-level degeneration* as the first point of intervention.

✅ **Coherence:** Strong.

Stage 2 clearly operationalizes the “fix the process, not the symptom” philosophy. The method integrates systems mapping, pattern recognition, and leverage-point analysis precisely as the Theoretical Foundation prescribes.

### **Stage 3 – Design Brief (Three Spheres & Nested Scales)**

**Theoretical foundation:** Regenesis’ *Three Spheres of Regeneration* + *Nested Scales Thinking* + Critical Urban Theory (Lefebvre, Harvey, Jacobs).

**Observed in the Stage 3 document:**

* Design responses are structured across **economic, social, and ecological spheres** as  *interpenetrating aspects of one system* , not separate silos.
* Nested-scalar reasoning (from  **peatland ecology → local community → bioregional economy** ) demonstrates  **holarchic design logic** .
* Integration of  **critical urban theory** : challenges commodification, centers community agency, and frames the project as a defense against “accumulation by dispossession.”
* Explicit orientation toward **commons governance, shared equity, and non-extractive value systems** — perfectly aligned with Harvey and Lefebvre’s ideas.

✅ **Coherence:** Excellent.

Stage 3 synthesizes the regenerative design and critical urban theory strands seamlessly. It doesn’t merely translate assessment data into form—it  **frames design as a transformation of social metabolism and governance** , which is precisely the intent of the Regenesis + Critical Urban Theory integration.

### **Cross-Stage Integration**

| Theoretical Domain                                 | Stage 1                             | Stage 2                       | Stage 3                       | Coherence |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------- |
| **Regenerative Development (Regenesis)**     | Story of Place Inquiry              | Process Ecology               | Three Spheres + Nested Scales | ✅ Full   |
| **Carol Sanford – Regenerative Principles** | Essence Discovery                   | Essential Processes Health    | Locus of Control / Agency     | ✅ Full   |
| **Systems Thinking (Bateson, Meadows)**      | Pattern Listening                   | Leverage Point Identification | Systemic Alignment            | ✅ Full   |
| **Critical Urban Theory (Lefebvre, Harvey)** | Right to the City / Community Voice | Power & Capture Diagnosis     | Commons & Governance          | ✅ Full   |
| **Phenomenology / Indigenous Epistemology**  | Embodied Inquiry                    | Relational Health Assessment  | Design through Living Context | ✅ Full   |

### **Synthesis Judgment**

All three stages are  **coherent, sequential, and theoretically integrated** .

The evolution from *inquiry → assessment → synthesis* mirrors the Regenesis “evolutionary capacity-building” cycle and retains fidelity to both **regenerative ontology** (systems as living wholes) and **critical urban ethics** (anti-extractive, participatory, commons-oriented development).
