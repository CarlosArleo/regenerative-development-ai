## Stage 3: Design Brief

Validate essence and commitments

#### Validated Place Essence

A wounded but resilient landscape holding deep memory, where the tension between a legacy of industrial extraction and a future of ecological potential is calling for a new, reciprocal relationship between the community and the land. It is a place where ancestral wisdom seeks new hands to heal, and where the restoration of the water cycle is the foundational act of regeneration for both people and nature.

#### Proposed Intervention

To initiate a large-scale, community-led peatland restoration project focused on re-wetting the Moss. This intervention will be structured as a regenerative social enterprise that creates paid, land-based livelihoods for local youth, who will be mentored by Elders in traditional ecological knowledge. The project's primary goal is to reverse the Moss's carbon emissions and restore its function as a carbon sink, with the economic value generated from this restoration (e.g., carbon credits, educational tourism) being reinvested into the community to fund further ecological and social regeneration.


### **Stakeholder Commitments**

#### Commitment 1

* **Stakeholder Name:** **Elders & Long-Term Residents of Carrington**
* **What they commit to:** **To share their deep, lived knowledge of the Moss, including historical water patterns, traditional land use, and oral histories. They will act as mentors and guides for the younger generation, ensuring the restoration is grounded in the place's long memory.**
* **Their capacity:** **High** **(Their knowledge is a unique and invaluable asset that cannot be sourced elsewhere).**

#### Commitment 2

* **Stakeholder Name:** **Young Returnees & Local Youth**
* **What they commit to:** **To provide the core energy and on-the-ground team for the restoration work. They commit to participating in an apprenticeship program to learn traditional techniques from the Elders and to co-manage the resulting regenerative enterprise.**
* **Their capacity:** **Medium** **(High in energy and motivation, but currently low in specific skills and financial resources, which the project aims to build).**

#### Commitment 3

* **Stakeholder Name:** **Municipal Staff (Trafford Council Planning & Ecology Depts.)**
* **What they commit to:** **To act as internal allies, providing administrative support to help the project navigate the complex planning process. They will work to align the community's vision with the Local Plan, Greater Manchester's climate goals, and explore official pathways for commons designation or Community Asset Transfer.**
* **Their capacity:** **Medium** **(Constrained by budgets and political pressures, but able to provide crucial procedural guidance and unlock policy support).**

#### Commitment 4

* **Stakeholder Name:** **Allied Environmental Groups (e.g., Lancashire Wildlife Trust, CPRE)**
* **What they commit to:** **To provide scientific and technical expertise on peatland re-wetting, biodiversity monitoring, and habitat corridor design. They will also support funding applications and connect the local project to regional and national conservation networks.**
* **Their capacity:** **High** **(These organizations possess deep specialist expertise and established networks that the community can leverage).**
