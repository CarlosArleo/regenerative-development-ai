## **2. Critical Success Factors**

1. **Durable Legal Standing of the Charter** — Legal binding of Charter principles through planning policy (SPD) or land covenants.
2. **Securing Patient Capital** — Funding that supports long-term community-building rather than short-term outputs.
3. **Sustained Local Leadership** — Empowerment and resilience of the Intergenerational Council to steer the initiative.
4. **Tangible Early Success** — The *First Wound* pilot must generate visible ecological and social impact.
5. **Genuine Municipal Partnership** — Establishment of a co-governance model with local authorities built on trust and reciprocity.

| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **UK Environment Act 2021**                       | Supports Biodiversity Net Gain, nature recovery, and water quality goals.                                                |
| **Greater Manchester’s 5-Year Environment Plan** | Aligns with carbon neutrality via peatland restoration and climate resilience.                                           |
| **National Peatland Strategy (UK)**               | Direct implementation of peatland restoration and carbon sink objectives.                                                |
| **Levelling Up Agenda**                           | Addresses structural inequality and deindustrialization legacies through local green jobs and social capital rebuilding. |

### **3.2 Policy Conflicts**

* **Local Housing Delivery Targets:** Compete with large-scale restoration goals.
* **Regional Economic Growth Strategies:** Favor extractive and rapid development over regenerative models.

### **3.3 Proposed Resolutions**

* **Housing Targets:**

  Designate the Moss as *Green Belt* or  *Nature Recovery Area* ; frame restoration as essential flood mitigation.
* **Economic Growth:**

  Quantify and promote ecosystem services as economic assets (carbon, water, health), defining a *restoration economy* as a counter-pattern to extractive growth.

## **4. Implementation Scenario**

### **4.1 Community-Led Regenerative Trust Model**

A  **Community Land Trust (CLT)** — *The Carrington Moss Trust* —governed by the co-created Charter.

* **Board Composition:** Elders, Young Returnees, community members, and key partners.
* **Purpose:** Decentralize authority, establish land-based community sovereignty, and protect the  *right to remain* .

### **4.2 Timeline**

| Phase                             | Duration                                                                                                | Objectives |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Phase 1 (Months 1–12)**  | Establish Interim Council, secure seed funding, ratify Charter, legally incorporate CLT.                |            |
| **Phase 2 (Months 12–36)** | Deliver*First Wound*pilot, secure major grants, establish Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) model. |            |
| **Phase 3 (Years 3–10)**   | Scale restoration, generate local employment, and stabilize regenerative revenue streams.               |            |

## **6. Anti-Capture Mechanisms**

| Mechanism                                     | Description                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Community Land Trust (CLT)**          | Legal separation of land ownership from private interests; perpetual asset lock. |
| **Charter as Restrictive Covenant**     | Charter principles embedded in land title.                                       |
| **Community-Owned Ecosystem Services**  | All PES revenues flow to the Trust; prevents corporate capture.                  |
| **Anti-Displacement Strategy**          | Prioritize local residents in jobs/housing; monitor gentrification risks.        |
| **Ethical Ecosystem Services Protocol** | Transparent, anti-offsetting market engagement with multi-benefit stacking.      |
| **Right of First Refusal**              | Enables community acquisition of adjacent parcels.                               |
| **Ethical Funding Vetting Process**     | Council-led evaluation to prevent ‘greenwashing’ investments.                  |
