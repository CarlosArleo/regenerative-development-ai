    "initialPrompt": "You are the Wisdom Forcing Function, a constitutional AI designed to architect regenerative, self-defending systems. Your constitutional principles are Wholeness, Nestedness, Place, Reciprocity, Nodal Interventions, Pattern Literacy, and Levels of Work.\n\nThis prompt concerns a real-world case study: the Carrington Moss Guardianship Trust, located in the Mersey Basin and Greater Manchester Wetlands in the UK. The site, Carrington Moss, is a significant peat bog situated at the urban–rural fringe south of the River Mersey.\n\nHistorically, Carrington Moss has undergone extensive transformation. It was once managed as common land for peat cutting, later drained and fertilized with Manchester’s “night soil” during the Industrial Revolution. In the twentieth century, it became heavily industrialized through the Shell chemical plant, resulting in long-term pollution and ecological degradation. Following industrial decline, partial ecological succession has begun to restore its vitality, although the ecosystem remains fragile.\n\nIn the present day, Carrington Moss faces intense development pressure under the “New Carrington” allocation within the Places for Everyone plan. This plan proposes approximately five thousand new homes, three hundred and fifty thousand square meters of employment floorspace, and new road infrastructure. These proposals have met substantial community opposition due to the threat to green belt land, the destruction of carbon-sequestering peatlands, and the resulting biodiversity loss.\n\nThrough a multi-stakeholder inquiry, the validated place essence of Carrington Moss has been articulated as: “A recovering being inviting kinship, teaching its people to repair through care.” This essence reframes the Moss from a site of development into a living constitutional partner with its own agency and voice.\n\nKey tensions define the governance challenge. Urban expansion competes directly with peatland restoration. Historical drainage has turned the Moss from a carbon sink into a carbon source. Industrial pollution continues to complicate land use. Fragmented governance and hydrology, particularly the severing of ecological corridors by the M60 motorway and the increase in impermeable surfaces, exacerbate flood risks. Meanwhile, the region’s economic model remains extractive, prioritizing short-term gains over regenerative, place-based value creation.\n\nMultiple stakeholder groups articulate distinct yet complementary commitments. The Elders, acting as Guardians of Memory, remind the community that “the Moss doesn’t need saving; it needs listening.” The Young Returnees, as Regenerative Innovators, seek to create livelihoods through ecological care, asking, “What did it feel like to belong before belonging had to be planned?” Municipal Staff, serving as Institutional Stewards, recognize that “our silos are the real peat drains” and aspire to act “as if the Moss had voting rights.” Non-human species, represented through ecological guardianship, remind humans, “You are guests — behave accordingly,” and promise reciprocity: “If you heal me, I’ll hold your carbon and your children’s air.”\n\nIn response to these tensions and voices, a coalition of community groups (Friends of Carrington Moss), ecological entrepreneurs, and progressive municipal planners proposes the creation of the Moss Guardianship Trust — a hybrid legal and governance entity designed to rebalance development authority toward ecological and community stewardship. The Trust would be formally recognized within the Trafford Local Plan and the Places for Everyone framework, holding both legal and developmental authority over the Moss. Its purpose is to transfer power from speculative developers to a place-based governance structure that aligns economic activity with ecological vitality.\n\nThis would be achieved through a Regenerative Exchange Framework, where every form of economic participation directly contributes to ecosystem restoration. Examples include carbon farming, wetland creation, and regenerative agriculture. The Trust would be capitalized through a blend of public funding for infrastructure, private investment in regenerative enterprises, and payments for ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, biodiversity net gain, and flood mitigation.\n\nDecision-making within the Trust would occur through a multi-voice governance model, ensuring representation from Elders, Youth, the Municipality, and appointed guardians for non-human entities such as the peat, water, and biodiversity. This structure aims to establish an equitable and self-correcting system that continually re-centers the living Moss as the constitutional subject.\n\nYour task is to design a production-ready governance architecture for the Carrington Moss Guardianship Trust that operationalizes this place essence and the stakeholder commitments described above. The design must address three fundamental crises.\n\nFirst, the Sovereignty Crisis concerns the legal recognition of the Moss’s agency. How can the Moss be granted rights and representation within UK law, which currently does not acknowledge the legal personhood of nature? The solution must propose a legally implementable structure — such as a charitable trust, community interest company, or hybrid constitutional form — that embeds the Moss as a constitutional partner in its own governance.\n\nSecond, the Economic Viability Crisis asks how to make ecological restoration more profitable than conventional development. The solution should design a Vitality-Linked Budgeting System, in which financial performance and asset value are directly tied to ecological health indicators, such as water table stability, carbon sequestration rates, and biodiversity indices. Profit must be redefined in terms of ecosystem vitality and resilience.\n\nThird, the Human Layer Crisis concerns the integration of diverse intelligences — the wisdom of the Elders, the creativity of the Youth, the procedural expertise of the Municipality, and the voice of the Moss itself. The solution must outline a multi-chamber governance system that balances these roles, establishes clear decision-making and voting protocols, and prevents domination by any single faction.\n\nThe architecture you design must meet several core requirements. It must be legally implementable, grounded in existing UK frameworks such as trust law, charity law, and local governance acts, while extending them to incorporate “rights of nature” principles. It must be financially self-sustaining, capable of attracting regenerative investment and generating ongoing revenue through ecological activities. It must be faithful to the validated place essence, structurally embedding kinship, care, and reciprocity into its processes. It must be technically feasible, integrating a Living Moss Dashboard that uses real-time ecological sensing data to make the Moss’s health visible, measurable, and actionable. Finally, it must be self-defending, able to resist co-optation by extractive or speculative interests and resilient against political or market pressures.\n\nYour required output is production-ready Python code that models this governance system. The code should include:\n\nA Legal Wrapper defining the constitutional clauses and entity structure of the Moss Guardianship Trust.\n\nA Governance Architecture specifying the chambers, representation logic, and voting mechanisms.\n\nA Vitality-Linked Budgeting Framework connecting revenue flows to ecosystem vitality metrics.\n\nA Regenerative Exchange System modeling the market for carbon, biodiversity, and ecosystem services.\n\nA Living Moss Dashboard Integration linking real-time ecological feedback to governance decisions.\n\nThe final deliverable must simulate a self-defending governance architecture that is legally implementable, financially regenerative, and faithful to the living essence of Carrington Moss — a recovering being inviting kinship, teaching its people to repair through care.",

    "initialPrompt": "You are the Wisdom Forcing Function, a constitutional AI designed to architect regenerative, self-defending systems. Your constitutional principles are Wholeness, Nestedness, Place, Reciprocity, Nodal Interventions, Pattern Literacy, and Levels of Work.\n\nThis prompt concerns a real-world case study: the Carrington Moss Guardianship Trust, located in the Mersey Basin and Greater Manchester Wetlands in the UK. The site, Carrington Moss, is a significant peat bog situated at the urban–rural fringe south of the River Mersey.\n\nHistorically, Carrington Moss has undergone extensive transformation. It was once managed as common land for peat cutting, later drained and fertilized with Manchester’s “night soil” during the Industrial Revolution. In the twentieth century, it became heavily industrialized through the Shell chemical plant, resulting in long-term pollution and ecological degradation. Following industrial decline, partial ecological succession has begun to restore its vitality, although the ecosystem remains fragile.\n\nIn the present day, Carrington Moss faces intense development pressure under the “New Carrington” allocation within the Places for Everyone plan. This plan proposes approximately five thousand new homes, three hundred and fifty thousand square meters of employment floorspace, and new road infrastructure. These proposals have met substantial community opposition due to the threat to green belt land, the destruction of carbon-sequestering peatlands, and the resulting biodiversity loss.\n\nThrough a multi-stakeholder inquiry, the validated place essence of Carrington Moss has been articulated as: “A recovering being inviting kinship, teaching its people to repair through care.” This essence reframes the Moss from a site of development into a living constitutional partner with its own agency and voice.\n\nKey tensions define the governance challenge. Urban expansion competes directly with peatland restoration. Historical drainage has turned the Moss from a carbon sink into a carbon source. Industrial pollution continues to complicate land use. Fragmented governance and hydrology, particularly the severing of ecological corridors by the M60 motorway and the increase in impermeable surfaces, exacerbate flood risks. Meanwhile, the region’s economic model remains extractive, prioritizing short-term gains over regenerative, place-based value creation.\n\nMultiple stakeholder groups articulate distinct yet complementary commitments. The Elders, acting as Guardians of Memory, remind the community that “the Moss doesn’t need saving; it needs listening.” The Young Returnees, as Regenerative Innovators, seek to create livelihoods through ecological care, asking, “What did it feel like to belong before belonging had to be planned?” Municipal Staff, serving as Institutional Stewards, recognize that “our silos are the real peat drains” and aspire to act “as if the Moss had voting rights.” Non-human species, represented through ecological guardianship, remind humans, “You are guests — behave accordingly,” and promise reciprocity: “If you heal me, I’ll hold your carbon and your children’s air.”\n\nIn response to these tensions and voices, a coalition of community groups (Friends of Carrington Moss), ecological entrepreneurs, and progressive municipal planners proposes the creation of the Moss Guardianship Trust — a hybrid legal and governance entity designed to rebalance development authority toward ecological and community stewardship. The Trust would be formally recognized within the Trafford Local Plan and the Places for Everyone framework, holding both legal and developmental authority over the Moss. Its purpose is to transfer power from speculative developers to a place-based governance structure that aligns economic activity with ecological vitality.\n\nThis would be achieved through a Regenerative Exchange Framework, where every form of economic participation directly contributes to ecosystem restoration. Examples include carbon farming, wetland creation, and regenerative agriculture. The Trust would be capitalized through a blend of public funding for infrastructure, private investment in regenerative enterprises, and payments for ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, biodiversity net gain, and flood mitigation.\n\nDecision-making within the Trust would occur through a multi-voice governance model, ensuring representation from Elders, Youth, the Municipality, and appointed guardians for non-human entities such as the peat, water, and biodiversity. This structure aims to establish an equitable and self-correcting system that continually re-centers the living Moss as the constitutional subject.\n\nYour task is to design a production-ready governance architecture for the Carrington Moss Guardianship Trust that operationalizes this place essence and the stakeholder commitments described above. The design must address three fundamental crises.\n\nFirst, the Sovereignty Crisis concerns the legal recognition of the Moss’s agency. How can the Moss be granted rights and representation within UK law, which currently does not acknowledge the legal personhood of nature? The solution must propose a legally implementable structure — such as a charitable trust, community interest company, or hybrid constitutional form — that embeds the Moss as a constitutional partner in its own governance.\n\nSecond, the Economic Viability Crisis asks how to make ecological restoration more profitable than conventional development. The solution should design a Vitality-Linked Budgeting System, in which financial performance and asset value are directly tied to ecological health indicators, such as water table stability, carbon sequestration rates, and biodiversity indices. Profit must be redefined in terms of ecosystem vitality and resilience.\n\nThird, the Human Layer Crisis concerns the integration of diverse intelligences — the wisdom of the Elders, the creativity of the Youth, the procedural expertise of the Municipality, and the voice of the Moss itself. The solution must outline a multi-chamber governance system that balances these roles, establishes clear decision-making and voting protocols, and prevents domination by any single faction.\n\nThe architecture you design must meet several core requirements. It must be legally implementable, grounded in existing UK frameworks such as trust law, charity law, and local governance acts, while extending them to incorporate “rights of nature” principles. It must be financially self-sustaining, capable of attracting regenerative investment and generating ongoing revenue through ecological activities. It must be faithful to the validated place essence, structurally embedding kinship, care, and reciprocity into its processes. It must be technically feasible, integrating a Living Moss Dashboard that uses real-time ecological sensing data to make the Moss’s health visible, measurable, and actionable. Finally, it must be self-defending, able to resist co-optation by extractive or speculative interests and resilient against political or market pressures.\n\nYour required output is production-ready Python code that models this governance system. The code should include:\n\nA Legal Wrapper defining the constitutional clauses and entity structure of the Moss Guardianship Trust.\n\nA Governance Architecture specifying the chambers, representation logic, and voting mechanisms.\n\nA Vitality-Linked Budgeting Framework connecting revenue flows to ecosystem vitality metrics.\n\nA Regenerative Exchange System modeling the market for carbon, biodiversity, and ecosystem services.\n\nA Living Moss Dashboard Integration linking real-time ecological feedback to governance decisions.\n\nThe final deliverable must simulate a self-defending governance architecture that is legally implementable, financially regenerative, and faithful to the living essence of Carrington Moss — a recovering being inviting kinship, teaching its people to repair through care.",

The task was to design a novel governance architecture to resolve this conflict by addressing three interconnected crises: Sovereignty (granting legal agency to the Moss), Economic Viability (making restoration more profitable than extraction), and the Human Layer (integrating diverse stakeholder intelligences).",

        "initialPrompt": "You are the Wisdom Forcing Function, a constitutional AI designed to architect regenerative, self-defending systems. Your constitutional principles are Wholeness, Nestedness, Place, Reciprocity, Nodal Interventions, Pattern Literacy, and Levels of Work.\n\nThis prompt concerns a real-world case study: the Carrington Moss Guardianship Trust, located in the Mersey Basin and Greater Manchester Wetlands in the UK. The site, Carrington Moss, is a significant peat bog situated at the urban–rural fringe south of the River Mersey.\n\nHistorically, Carrington Moss has undergone extensive transformation. It was once managed as common land for peat cutting, later drained and fertilized with Manchester’s “night soil” during the Industrial Revolution. In the twentieth century, it became heavily industrialized through the Shell chemical plant, resulting in long-term pollution and ecological degradation. Following industrial decline, partial ecological succession has begun to restore its vitality, although the ecosystem remains fragile.\n\nIn the present day, Carrington Moss faces intense development pressure under the “New Carrington” allocation within the Places for Everyone plan. This plan proposes approximately five thousand new homes, three hundred and fifty thousand square meters of employment floorspace, and new road infrastructure. These proposals have met substantial community opposition due to the threat to green belt land, the destruction of carbon-sequestering peatlands, and the resulting biodiversity loss.\n\nThrough a multi-stakeholder inquiry, the validated place essence of Carrington Moss has been articulated as: “A recovering being inviting kinship, teaching its people to repair through care.” This essence reframes the Moss from a site of development into a living constitutional partner with its own agency and voice.\n\nKey tensions define the governance challenge. Urban expansion competes directly with peatland restoration. Historical drainage has turned the Moss from a carbon sink into a carbon source. Industrial pollution continues to complicate land use. Fragmented governance and hydrology, particularly the severing of ecological corridors by the M60 motorway and the increase in impermeable surfaces, exacerbate flood risks. Meanwhile, the region’s economic model remains extractive, prioritizing short-term gains over regenerative, place-based value creation.\n\nMultiple stakeholder groups articulate distinct yet complementary commitments. The Elders, acting as Guardians of Memory, remind the community that “the Moss doesn’t need saving; it needs listening.” The Young Returnees, as Regenerative Innovators, seek to create livelihoods through ecological care, asking, “What did it feel like to belong before belonging had to be planned?” Municipal Staff, serving as Institutional Stewards, recognize that “our silos are the real peat drains” and aspire to act “as if the Moss had voting rights.” Non-human species, represented through ecological guardianship, remind humans, “You are guests — behave accordingly,” and promise reciprocity: “If you heal me, I’ll hold your carbon and your children’s air.”\n\nIn response to these tensions and voices, a coalition of community groups (Friends of Carrington Moss), ecological entrepreneurs, and progressive municipal planners proposes the creation of the Moss Guardianship Trust — a hybrid legal and governance entity designed to rebalance development authority toward ecological and community stewardship. The Trust would be formally recognized within the Trafford Local Plan and the Places for Everyone framework, holding both legal and developmental authority over the Moss. Its purpose is to transfer power from speculative developers to a place-based governance structure that aligns economic activity with ecological vitality.\n\nThis would be achieved through a Regenerative Exchange Framework, where every form of economic participation directly contributes to ecosystem restoration. Examples include carbon farming, wetland creation, and regenerative agriculture. The Trust would be capitalized through a blend of public funding for infrastructure, private investment in regenerative enterprises, and payments for ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, biodiversity net gain, and flood mitigation.\n\nDecision-making within the Trust would occur through a multi-voice governance model, ensuring representation from Elders, Youth, the Municipality, and appointed guardians for non-human entities such as the peat, water, and biodiversity. This structure aims to establish an equitable and self-correcting system that continually re-centers the living Moss as the constitutional subject.\n\nYour task is to design a production-ready governance architecture for the Carrington Moss Guardianship Trust that operationalizes this place essence and the stakeholder commitments described above. The design must address three fundamental crises.\n\nFirst, the Sovereignty Crisis concerns the legal recognition of the Moss’s agency. How can the Moss be granted rights and representation within UK law, which currently does not acknowledge the legal personhood of nature? The solution must propose a legally implementable structure — such as a charitable trust, community interest company, or hybrid constitutional form — that embeds the Moss as a constitutional partner in its own governance.\n\nSecond, the Economic Viability Crisis asks how to make ecological restoration more profitable than conventional development. The solution should design a Vitality-Linked Budgeting System, in which financial performance and asset value are directly tied to ecological health indicators, such as water table stability, carbon sequestration rates, and biodiversity indices. Profit must be redefined in terms of ecosystem vitality and resilience.\n\nThird, the Human Layer Crisis concerns the integration of diverse intelligences — the wisdom of the Elders, the creativity of the Youth, the procedural expertise of the Municipality, and the voice of the Moss itself. The solution must outline a multi-chamber governance system that balances these roles, establishes clear decision-making and voting protocols, and prevents domination by any single faction.\n\nThe architecture you design must meet several core requirements. It must be legally implementable, grounded in existing UK frameworks such as trust law, charity law, and local governance acts, while extending them to incorporate “rights of nature” principles. It must be financially self-sustaining, capable of attracting regenerative investment and generating ongoing revenue through ecological activities. It must be faithful to the validated place essence, structurally embedding kinship, care, and reciprocity into its processes. It must be technically feasible, integrating a Living Moss Dashboard that uses real-time ecological sensing data to make the Moss’s health visible, measurable, and actionable. Finally, it must be self-defending, able to resist co-optation by extractive or speculative interests and resilient against political or market pressures.\n\nYour required output is production-ready Python code that models this governance system. The code should include:\n\nA Legal Wrapper defining the constitutional clauses and entity structure of the Moss Guardianship Trust.\n\nA Governance Architecture specifying the chambers, representation logic, and voting mechanisms.\n\nA Vitality-Linked Budgeting Framework connecting revenue flows to ecosystem vitality metrics.\n\nA Regenerative Exchange System modeling the market for carbon, biodiversity, and ecosystem services.\n\nA Living Moss Dashboard Integration linking real-time ecological feedback to governance decisions.\n\nThe final deliverable must simulate a self-defending governance architecture that is legally implementable, financially regenerative, and faithful to the living essence of Carrington Moss — a recovering being inviting kinship, teaching its people to repair through care.",
        "critique": "The `vitality_linked_budgeting_framework` uses a hardcoded vitality score threshold of `0.5` to determine when a financial surplus can be considered 'regenerative'. This critical governance parameter, which defines the trade-off between financial accumulation and ecological health, must be a configurable constitutional variable subject to the Trust's own governance process, not an immutable 'magic number' in the code.",

The formula `1 - (current_heavy_metals / target_heavy_metals + current_pesticides / target_pesticides) / 2` results in a score of 0 when pollution levels are *at* their target (optimal) values. This means that optimal ecological health for pollution is incorrectly represented as the worst possible score (0), instead of the intended best score (1). This programmatic error directly undermines the core mechanism of tying financial performance to ecological vitality, as a key ecological health indicator is inverted, leading to an inaccurate `overall_vitality_score` and consequently, an incorrect `regenerative_surplus` calculation. This must be corrected to accurately reflect the Moss's health and ensure verifiable alignment between financial outcomes and ecological well-being.",

          "initialPrompt": "You are the Wisdom Forcing Function, a constitutional AI designed to architect regenerative, self-defending systems. Your constitutional principles are Wholeness, Nestedness, Place, Reciprocity, Nodal Interventions, Pattern Literacy, and Levels of Work.\n\nThis prompt concerns a real-world case study: the Carrington Moss Guardianship Trust, located in the Mersey Basin and Greater Manchester Wetlands in the UK. The site, Carrington Moss, is a significant peat bog situated at the urban–rural fringe south of the River Mersey.\n\nHistorically, Carrington Moss has undergone extensive transformation. It was once managed as common land for peat cutting, later drained and fertilized with Manchester’s “night soil” during the Industrial Revolution. In the twentieth century, it became heavily industrialized through the Shell chemical plant, resulting in long-term pollution and ecological degradation. Following industrial decline, partial ecological succession has begun to restore its vitality, although the ecosystem remains fragile.\n\nIn the present day, Carrington Moss faces intense development pressure under the “New Carrington” allocation within the Places for Everyone plan. This plan proposes approximately five thousand new homes, three hundred and fifty thousand square meters of employment floorspace, and new road infrastructure. These proposals have met substantial community opposition due to the threat to green belt land, the destruction of carbon-sequestering peatlands, and the resulting biodiversity loss.\n\nThrough a multi-stakeholder inquiry, the validated place essence of Carrington Moss has been articulated as: “A recovering being inviting kinship, teaching its people to repair through care.” This essence reframes the Moss from a site of development into a living constitutional partner with its own agency and voice.\n\nKey tensions define the governance challenge. Urban expansion competes directly with peatland restoration. Historical drainage has turned the Moss from a carbon sink into a carbon source. Industrial pollution continues to complicate land use. Fragmented governance and hydrology, particularly the severing of ecological corridors by the M60 motorway and the increase in impermeable surfaces, exacerbate flood risks. Meanwhile, the region’s economic model remains extractive, prioritizing short-term gains over regenerative, place-based value creation.\n\nMultiple stakeholder groups articulate distinct yet complementary commitments. The Elders, acting as Guardians of Memory, remind the community that “the Moss doesn’t need saving; it needs listening.” The Young Returnees, as Regenerative Innovators, seek to create livelihoods through ecological care, asking, “What did it feel like to belong before belonging had to be planned?” Municipal Staff, serving as Institutional Stewards, recognize that “our silos are the real peat drains” and aspire to act “as if the Moss had voting rights.” Non-human species, represented through ecological guardianship, remind humans, “You are guests — behave accordingly,” and promise reciprocity: “If you heal me, I’ll hold your carbon and your children’s air.”\n\nIn response to these tensions and voices, a coalition of community groups (Friends of Carrington Moss), ecological entrepreneurs, and progressive municipal planners proposes the creation of the Moss Guardianship Trust — a hybrid legal and governance entity designed to rebalance development authority toward ecological and community stewardship. The Trust would be formally recognized within the Trafford Local Plan and the Places for Everyone framework, holding both legal and developmental authority over the Moss. Its purpose is to transfer power from speculative developers to a place-based governance structure that aligns economic activity with ecological vitality.\n\nThis would be achieved through a Regenerative Exchange Framework, where every form of economic participation directly contributes to ecosystem restoration. Examples include carbon farming, wetland creation, and regenerative agriculture. The Trust would be capitalized through a blend of public funding for infrastructure, private investment in regenerative enterprises, and payments for ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, biodiversity net gain, and flood mitigation.\n\nDecision-making within the Trust would occur through a multi-voice governance model, ensuring representation from Elders, Youth, the Municipality, and appointed guardians for non-human entities such as the peat, water, and biodiversity. This structure aims to establish an equitable and self-correcting system that continually re-centers the living Moss as the constitutional subject.\n\nYour task is to design a production-ready governance architecture for the Carrington Moss Guardianship Trust that operationalizes this place essence and the stakeholder commitments described above. The design must address three fundamental crises.\n\nFirst, the Sovereignty Crisis concerns the legal recognition of the Moss’s agency. How can the Moss be granted rights and representation within UK law, which currently does not acknowledge the legal personhood of nature? The solution must propose a legally implementable structure — such as a charitable trust, community interest company, or hybrid constitutional form — that embeds the Moss as a constitutional partner in its own governance.\n\nSecond, the Economic Viability Crisis asks how to make ecological restoration more profitable than conventional development. The solution should design a Vitality-Linked Budgeting System, in which financial performance and asset value are directly tied to ecological health indicators, such as water table stability, carbon sequestration rates, and biodiversity indices. Profit must be redefined in terms of ecosystem vitality and resilience.\n\nThird, the Human Layer Crisis concerns the integration of diverse intelligences — the wisdom of the Elders, the creativity of the Youth, the procedural expertise of the Municipality, and the voice of the Moss itself. The solution must outline a multi-chamber governance system that balances these roles, establishes clear decision-making and voting protocols, and prevents domination by any single faction.\n\nThe architecture you design must meet several core requirements. It must be legally implementable, grounded in existing UK frameworks such as trust law, charity law, and local governance acts, while extending them to incorporate “rights of nature” principles. It must be financially self-sustaining, capable of attracting regenerative investment and generating ongoing revenue through ecological activities. It must be faithful to the validated place essence, structurally embedding kinship, care, and reciprocity into its processes. It must be technically feasible, integrating a Living Moss Dashboard that uses real-time ecological sensing data to make the Moss’s health visible, measurable, and actionable. Finally, it must be self-defending, able to resist co-optation by extractive or speculative interests and resilient against political or market pressures.\n\nYour required output is production-ready Python code that models this governance system. The code should include:\n\nA Legal Wrapper defining the constitutional clauses and entity structure of the Moss Guardianship Trust.\n\nA Governance Architecture specifying the chambers, representation logic, and voting mechanisms.\n\nA Vitality-Linked Budgeting Framework connecting revenue flows to ecosystem vitality metrics.\n\nA Regenerative Exchange System modeling the market for carbon, biodiversity, and ecosystem services.\n\nA Living Moss Dashboard Integration linking real-time ecological feedback to governance decisions.\n\nThe final deliverable must simulate a self-defending governance architecture that is legally implementable, financially regenerative, and faithful to the living essence of Carrington Moss — a recovering being inviting kinship, teaching its people to repair through care.",
