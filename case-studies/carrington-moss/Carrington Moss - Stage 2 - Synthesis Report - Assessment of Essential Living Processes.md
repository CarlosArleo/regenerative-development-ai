# **Stage Two Synthesis Report: Carrington Moss – Assessment of Essential Living Processes**

### **Overview**

The second stage of the *Carrington Moss Inquiry* moves from listening to synthesis — translating the stories, patterns, and tensions surfaced during the stakeholder dialogues into an assessment of the living processes that underpin the health and potential of the place.

Using the  **Essential Processes Framework** , each process— *Nourishment, Shelter & Habitat, Resource Generation & Exchange, Identity & Belonging, Meaningful Contribution, and Spirit & Inspiration* —is evaluated in terms of  **ecological, economic, and social health** , with degradation patterns identified and leverage points proposed.

This stage transforms the qualitative insights gathered during Stage One into actionable intelligence for regenerative design and governance.

## **1. Nourishment**

**Overall Health: 24 / 100**

* Ecological Health: 20
* Economic Health: 30
* Social Health: 25

### **Patterns of Degradation**

* The threatened destruction of **peatland systems** undermines Carrington’s natural water regulation and carbon sequestration capacity.
* Agricultural land, once the “lifeblood” of the community, faces  **paving and enclosure** , severing local food production flows.
* Dominant planning discourses frame living systems as  *“underused”* , disregarding their systemic role in nourishing both ecology and community.

### **Leverage Points for Regeneration**

* **Valuation of Ecosystem Services** : Quantify and legally protect the flood mitigation and carbon storage functions of the peatland.
* **Reintegration of Agroecology** : Embed local food production (community farms, edible corridors, and allotments) into the spatial design of the new development.

## **2. Shelter & Habitat**

**Overall Health: 23 / 100**

* Ecological Health: 15
* Economic Health: 40
* Social Health: 20

### **Patterns of Degradation**

* Conversion of green belt and peatland into **mono-functional human housing** eliminates ecological habitats.
* The **social habitat** of the existing community—its sense of safety and continuity—is being displaced.
* Housing provision is being pursued as a **quantitative target** rather than a process of community integration and resilience-building.

### **Leverage Points for Regeneration**

* Introduce a **community-led or co-housing component** within the masterplan to enable resident stewardship and long-term custodianship.
* Design the development to **stitch into** the existing village fabric, maintaining permeability and mutual support rather than replacement.

---

## **3. Resource Generation & Exchange**

**Overall Health: 30 / 100**

* Ecological Health: 20
* Economic Health: 50
* Social Health: 30

### **Patterns of Degradation**

* Economic flows have shifted from **regenerative land-based livelihoods** (farming, stewardship) to  **extractive property development** .
* The **uplift in land value** benefits external investors rather than the host community.
* Access to housing for one demographic (new residents) is achieved through **resource deprivation** for another (farmers, local tenants).

### **Leverage Points for Regeneration**

* **Community Land Trust (CLT)** to capture and redistribute value for long-term community benefit.
* **Mandatory local reinvestment clauses** requiring developers to fund local enterprise, food systems, and infrastructure.

---

## **4. Identity & Belonging**

**Overall Health: 16 / 100**

* Ecological Health: 25
* Economic Health: 20
* Social Health: 10

### **Patterns of Degradation**

* Systematic **erasure of place identity** and multi-generational memory tied to the peatland landscape.
* Imposition of **generic, placeless design** narratives under the guise of “modern community.”
* The **stigmatization of existing residents** through the rhetoric of “underuse” and “low productivity.”

### **Leverage Points for Regeneration**

* Launch a **Cultural Mapping Process** that archives oral histories, local narratives, and land-based practices, making them visible in the planning discourse.
* Embed local identity into the  **spatial language of place** —street names, public art, and design gestures grounded in the vernacular and ecological history.

---

## **5. Meaningful Contribution**

**Overall Health: 19 / 100**

* Ecological Health: 30
* Economic Health: 25
* Social Health: 10

### **Patterns of Degradation**

* Local voices are **systematically excluded** from decision-making (“No one asked us”).
* Residents are treated as **obstacles** to development rather than as holders of vital stewardship knowledge.
* The traditional  **contribution of the community** —land care, local food systems—is being dismantled.

### **Leverage Points for Regeneration**

* Establish a **Co-Governance Board** with local representatives empowered to shape and veto critical development decisions.
* Replace tokenistic consultation with **community-led design charrettes** focusing on specific parcels or functions within the new masterplan.

## **6. Spirit & Inspiration** *(partial data — inferred continuation)*

**Preliminary Interpretation**

The stories shared during Stage One revealed an ongoing erosion of spiritual reciprocity between people and place. The Moss, once regarded as a living partner, is now treated as a blank surface for extraction. Yet beneath this, an enduring **“quiet resilience”** persists—expressed in memories of wild geese, the smell of wet soil, and the rhythm of the seasons.

### **Leverage Points for Regeneration**

* Ritualize **moments of collective gratitude and listening** in the planning process (e.g., seasonal walks, land acknowledgements).
* Treat the  **Moss as a teacher** , embedding its logic of slow renewal and layered history into the design and governance ethos of Carrington’s future.

---

## **Cross-Process Patterns**

* **Disconnection Across Scales:** Ecological, economic, and social processes operate in silos, reinforcing extractive dynamics.
* **Temporal Myopia:** Planning cycles privilege short-term economic gain over the long-term metabolism of the land.
* **Erasure of Local Wisdom:** Intergenerational and non-human knowledge systems are marginalized in favor of technical and financial rationalities.

## **Emerging Systemic Leverage Points**

1. **Reframe Development as Ecological Regeneration:** Require measurable contributions to the living systems that sustain Carrington (soil, water, biodiversity).
2. **Institutionalize Reciprocity:** Embed community benefit mechanisms (CLTs, participatory budgeting, co-housing) as governance norms.
3. **Activate Cultural Memory:** Use cultural mapping, storytelling, and design language to reconnect development with the deep identity of the place.
4. **Governance as Stewardship:** Shift from control-based governance to one oriented around co-evolution and care.

## **Conclusion**

Carrington Moss stands at the threshold between erasure and renewal. The Stage Two synthesis reveals both the extent of systemic degradation and the existence of potent seeds for regeneration.

If leveraged wisely—through community stewardship, cultural continuity, and ecological design—the place could evolve into a model for **regenerative urban-rural cohabitation** in Greater Manchester.
