## Non-Goals

**What we won't do:**

❌ **Venture capital funding** - No extractive investment

❌ **Proprietary pivot** - Always open source

❌ **Replace practitioners** - Always human-in-loop

❌ **Bypass communities** - Never automate consent

❌ **Extractive pricing** - Never unaffordable

❌ **Data extraction** - Community data stays community data

❌ **Surveillance** - No tracking, no profiling

❌ **Algorithmic determinism** - No "optimal" solutions

❌ **Top-down imposition** - Community choice always respected

❌ **Greenwashing** - Refuse extractive uses
