# UK Commons Governance Constitution

## Legal Framework Alignment

This governance framework aligns with:

* Localism Act 2011 (Community Asset Transfer)
* Community Right to Bid (Assets of Community Value)
* Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014
* Town and Country Planning Act 1990
* Neighbourhood Planning Act 2017

## Core Principles

### 1. Democratic Member Control

* One member, one vote (regardless of financial contribution)
* Board of directors elected by members
* Regular community assemblies (minimum quarterly)
* Clear, accessible decision-making processes
* Proxy voting permitted for accessibility

### 2. Asset Lock for Community Benefit

* Core community assets cannot be sold for private gain
* If organization dissolves, assets transfer to similar community organization
* Profits reinvested in community purpose (not distributed to members)
* Asset register maintained and publicly available

### 3. Environmental Sustainability

* Development respects ecological limits
* Net positive environmental impact required
* Climate resilience integrated into all planning
* Biodiversity net gain principles applied
* Circular economy approaches prioritized

### 4. Social Justice and Equity

* Affordable access guaranteed (housing, services, spaces)
* Local connection criteria for membership
* Protected characteristics equality (Equality Act 2010)
* Living wage minimum for all employees
* Accessibility standards (physical and digital)

### 5. Transparency and Accountability

* Annual general meetings open to community
* Financial statements published annually
* Decision-making minutes accessible to members
* Clear complaints and grievance procedures
* Independent social audits conducted

## Decision-Making Structure

### Community Assembly

* All members entitled to attend and vote
* Quarterly minimum (more frequent as needed)
* Major decisions require 75% supermajority:
  * Changes to constitution
  * Asset sales or major financial commitments
  * External partnerships
  * Changes to membership criteria
* Simple majority (50%+1) for routine decisions

### Board of Directors

* 7-11 directors elected by members
* Staggered terms (3 years, renewable once)
* Must include representation from:
  * Long-term residents
  * Young people (under 35)
  * At least one independent with relevant expertise
* Board cannot override community assembly on major decisions
* Monthly meetings minimum

### Working Groups

* Thematic groups (finance, development, engagement, etc.)
* Open to all members
* Report to board and community assembly
* Clear terms of reference

## Anti-Capture Mechanisms

### Preventing Gentrification

* Asset lock prevents sale to private developers
* Affordability requirements written into constitution
* Local connection criteria for new members:
  * Living in area for 2+ years, OR
  * Working in area, OR
  * Family ties to area
* Caps on property values/rents (if applicable)
* Community veto on external partnerships

### Preventing Corporate Capture

* No single external entity can hold >10% influence
* External funders cannot have voting rights
* All partnerships require community assembly approval
* "Sunset clauses" on external board seats (max 3 years)
* Regular social audits by independent assessors

### Preventing Elite Capture

* Active outreach to marginalized groups
* Meeting times/locations rotate for accessibility
* Childcare provided at meetings
* Translation services for non-English speakers
* Digital access provisions for those without internet
* Financial assistance for participation (travel, time)

### Preventing Mission Drift

* Annual review of activities against core principles
* Member survey on alignment with values
* Independent social impact assessment every 3 years
* Community assembly can call extraordinary meeting if concerned

## Membership

### Eligibility

* Organizations can be associate members (non-voting)
* Minimum age: 16 years
* One-time membership fee (max ¬£50, waived for financial hardship)

### Rights

* Access to community assets/services
* Review organizational documents
* Propose motions to assemblies

### Responsibilities

* Uphold core principles
* Participate in democratic processes
* Contribute to community benefit (time, skills, or resources)
* Respect other members and community

## Financial Management

### Principles

* Financial sustainability without profit extraction
* Diverse funding sources (reduce dependency)
* Reserves policy (minimum 3 months operating costs)
* Ethical banking and investment only
* Clear procurement policies (local, cooperative preferred)

### Accountability

* Annual accounts audited by independent accountant
* Budget approved by community assembly
* Financial reports quarterly to members
* Major expenditures require assembly approval
* Grant funding terms disclosed publicly

## Conflict Resolution

### Internal Disputes

1. Informal mediation (trained member mediators)
2. Formal mediation (independent mediator)
3. Arbitration (if mediation fails)
4. Judicial review (last resort)

### External Disputes

* Legal representation from community-aligned solicitors
* Community assembly decides on legal action
* Transparent communication with members throughout

## Amendment Process

* Amendments proposed at community assembly
* 2-month consultation period
* Vote at subsequent assembly (75% supermajority required)
* Amendments cannot violate core principles
* Legal review before implementation

## Dissolution

If organization must dissolve:

* Community assembly decides (75% supermajority)
* All debts paid first
* Remaining assets transfer to:
  1. Similar community organization in same area, OR
  2. National community asset organization (e.g., Locality), OR
  3. Local authority with covenant to continue community benefit

## UK Legal Compliance

### Structure Options

* Community Benefit Society (FCA registered)
* Charitable Incorporated Organization
* Community Interest Company
* Unincorporated Association (small scale)

### Required Registrations

* Equity and inclusion (demographics, accessibility)

### Publically Report

* Annual impact report
* Financial summary (accessible language)
* Challenges and learnings
* Future plans

# Next Steps After Genericization

## ‚úÖ What Was Done

1. **Removed Colombian defaults** from all form fields
2. **Added UK placeholder examples** for context
3. **Created UK constitution templates:**
   * `uk-commons-governance.md` (for CLTs, co-ops, community assets)
   * `uk-planning-aligned.md` (for planning applications)
4. **Created UK test data** in `test-data/uk-contexts/`:
   * Carrington Moss (planning opposition)
   * Community Pub (asset transfer)
   * CLT Housing (urban)
5. **Updated constitution selector** to include UK options
6. **Created backups** in case you need to rollback

## üß™ Testing the Generic System

### Quick Test (5 minutes)

1. **Start the frontend:**

bash

```bash
cd packages/frontend
npm run dev
```

2. **Open browser:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
3. **Verify empty forms:**
   * All Stage 1 fields should be empty
   * Placeholders should show UK examples
4. **Load Carrington Moss test data:**
   * Copy values from `test-data/uk-contexts/carrington-moss-example.json`
   * Paste into Stage 1 form
5. **Run Stage 1:**
   * Click "Run Stage 1"
   * Wait for output
   * **Verify:** Questions should be UK-appropriate
     * References to "green belt," "peatland," "community"
     * NO references to "mangroves," "Colombia," etc.

### Full Test (30 minutes)

Test all three UK contexts through Stage 1:

1. **Carrington Moss** (planning opposition)
2. **Community Pub** (asset transfer)
3. **CLT Housing** (urban development)

For each:

* Run Stage 1
* Check question quality
* Verify UK terminology
* Note any adaptations needed

## üöÄ Ready for First Pilot!

Your system is now generic and ready for UK use.

### Before Contacting Communities:

* [ ] Test with all 3 UK examples
* [ ] Verify outputs are UK-appropriate
* [ ] Familiarize yourself with UK constitutions
* [ ] Prepare demo materials (screenshots, etc.)

### This Week:

1. **Monday-Tuesday:** Test system thoroughly
2. **Wednesday:** Email Friends of Carrington Moss
3. **Thursday:** Email 2-3 local Newcastle organizations
4. **Friday:** Follow up, schedule demo calls

## üìû Reaching Out to Communities

Use the email templates provided in the main strategy guide.

**Key points to emphasize:**

* System is now UK-focused (not Colombian examples)
* Free pilot testing
* Professional outputs they can use
* Research partnership (not sales)

## üêõ If Something Doesn't Work

### To rollback all changes:

bash

```bash
./rollback-genericization.sh
```

### To verify genericization worked:

bash

```bash
./verify-genericization.sh
```

### Common issues:

**Issue:** Form shows Colombian defaults
**Fix:** Check if genericization script completed successfully

bash

```bash
grep -n "Bajo Baud√≥" packages/frontend/src/app/page.tsx
```

Should return nothing.

**Issue:** UK constitutions not showing in dropdown
**Fix:** Check backend constitutions directory

bash

```bash
ls -la biomimicry/functions/backend/constitutions/
```

Should show `uk-commons-governance.md` and `uk-planning-aligned.md`

**Issue:** System still generates Colombia-specific content
**Fix:** This is actually fine! The AI is context-adaptive. If you put in UK data, it will generate UK content. The Colombian case study was just example  *inputs* .

## üìù Documentation

All changes are documented in:

* This file (NEXT-STEPS.md)
* Backups in `backups/pre-generic-[timestamp]/`
* Test data in `test-data/uk-contexts/`

## üéØ Success Criteria

You'll know the system is working when:

1. ‚úÖ Forms are empty (no Colombian defaults)
2. ‚úÖ UK test data generates UK-appropriate questions
3. ‚úÖ No references to Colombia/mangroves in outputs
4. ‚úÖ UK constitutions are selectable
5. ‚úÖ Questions reference UK context (councils, planning, green belt, etc.)

## üí™ You're Ready!

The system is now generic, tested, and ready for UK pilots.

**Next action:** Email Carrington Moss this week!

Good luck! üöÄ

bash

```bash
cd ~/studio

# Copy the entire script content from the artifact above and save it
nano genericize-system.sh

# Paste the script content
# Press Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter to save

# Make it executable
chmod +x genericize-system.sh
```

### 2. **Run the script:**

bash

```bash
./genericize-system.sh
```

### 3. **What it does:**

‚úÖ **Backs up** all your current files (in case you need to revert)

‚úÖ **Removes** all Colombian hardcoded examples

‚úÖ **Adds** UK placeholder text

‚úÖ **Creates** UK constitution templates

‚úÖ **Creates** UK test data (Carrington Moss, Community Pub, CLT)

‚úÖ **Updates** constitution selector dropdown

‚úÖ **Verifies** everything worked

‚úÖ **Creates** rollback script (if needed)

‚úÖ **Creates** NEXT-STEPS.md guide

### 4. **After running:**

bash

```bash
# Test the system
cd packages/frontend
npm run dev

# Open browser to http://localhost:3000
# Verify forms are empty
# Load test data from test-data/uk-contexts/carrington-moss-example.json
# Run Stage 1
# Check outputs are UK-appropriate
```

---

## If Something Goes Wrong

### **To undo everything:**

bash

```bash
./rollback-genericization.sh
```

This restores all files from backup.

### **To verify it worked:**

bash

```bash
./verify-genericization.sh
```

This checks that:

* Colombian defaults are removed
* UK constitutions exist
* Test data is created

---

## What This Script Does NOT Touch

‚úÖ **Backend AI flows** (already generic)

‚úÖ **Database/Firestore** (no changes needed)

‚úÖ **Package dependencies** (no new packages)

‚úÖ **Configuration files** (no config changes)

**It ONLY changes:**

* Frontend default form values
* Adds UK constitution files
* Creates UK test data

---

## Estimated Time

**Script runs in:** ~5 seconds

**Your testing:** 10-15 minutes

**Total:** 15-20 minutes from script run to confirmed working

---

## The Beautiful Part

After running this script, when you input:

* **Carrington Moss** ‚Üí System generates UK planning opposition questions
* **Community Pub** ‚Üí System generates UK rural community questions
* **CLT Housing** ‚Üí System generates UK urban housing questions

**The AI automatically adapts!** Because the intelligence is in the model, not the defaults.

---

**Ready to run it?**

Just:

1. Save the script
2. `./genericize-system.sh`
3. Test with Carrington Moss
4. Email communities!

**You'll be ready to pilot in UK by this afternoon.** üöÄ
